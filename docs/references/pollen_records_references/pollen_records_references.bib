	abstract = {Vegetation changes in Sierra de Gata (Cáceres-Salamanca, Spain) over Late Holocene. Biogeographic implications] Preliminary results are presented on the pollen analysis of El Payo mire (Salamanca, Spain), located in the western sector of the Central System of the Iberian Peninsula. The date obtained at the base is 3825 cal BP. Vegetation until recent times has been dominated by birch (Betula alba) forest, which shows a clear transition between more humid oak forests from Serra da Estrela and more continental pine-birch forests from Béjar mountain range. The impact of human activities is described and the presence of eurosiberian relic species in the pollen diagram like sweet chestnut, pedunculate oak, yew or elm, and in the area like beech, lime and hornbeam is discussed.},

In this work landscape changes in a mountainous area in central Spain are examined through the analysis of pollen at Pen˜a Negra mire (Ca´ceres), since its formation during the transition period between the third and second millennium cal. B.C. The study focuses on anthropogenic dynamics linked to the effects of livestock husbandry and the use of ﬁre for forest clearance, as the mire is located close to a natural pass across the Bejar Range. With this aim, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal accumulation rate are useful indicators to assess the increasing role of human inﬂuence on vegetation. Grazing activities are continuously detected from the base of the proﬁle, with maxima in the last millennium, while the use of ﬁre is more pronounced from 3000 to 1000 cal. B.P. The discontinuous presence through the proﬁle of forest species like chestnut, walnut, beech, elm or yew has also been analyzed.},

	abstract = {The sediments of Lago Grande di Monticchio, southern Italy, extend continuously from the present back to the penultimate glacial stage and have an independent lamination-based chronology of high precision and accuracy. Results are presented here from a detailed palynological investigation of that part of the sediment sequence that extends from the last millennia of the penultimate glacial stage to the ﬁrst stadial following the Last Interglacial (LI). Quantitative palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate reconstructions made from the palynological data are also presented. The onset of the LI is dated to 127.20 ka BP, a date that is consistent with other recent estimates; the duration of the LI is estimated to have been 17.70 ka. The palaeovegetation record indicates a transition period of 3.35 ka at the end of the penultimate glacial stage prior to the onset of the LI; no Younger Dryas-like oscillation is recorded, although the transition was interrupted by a brief event, lasting ca 250 years, during which pollen of woody taxa was reduced in abundance. Steppe vegetation dominated during the latter part of the penultimate full-glacial stage, but was replaced progressively by wooded steppe during the transition. Although the development of forest cover marked the onset of the LI, the forests were relatively open or discontinuous during the ﬁrst 2.65 ka, closing progressively thereafter and generally dominating between 123.00 and 109.50 ka BP. The end of the LI is dated to 109.50 ka BP, after which date forest cover became discontinuous and wooded steppe or steppe dominated during the 1.90 ka of the subsequent stadial. As might be expected, given the location of the lake, the composition of the LI forests differs markedly from those recorded from northern Europe, as well as from those recorded at other localities in southern Europe. The palaeoclimate reconstructions reveal complex changes in seasonality, the maximum coldest month mean temperatures being between 125.70 ka BP and 123.00 ka BP, whereas maxima for both annual temperature sum and the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration were between 120.60 ka BP and 115.80 ka BP. Reconstructed zonal mean values for all three climatic variables in the zones in which they peak exceed values at the locality today. Comparison with other palaeovegetation records of the LI from Europe reveals that forest cover generally opened up north of the Alpine region probably ca 115 ka BP, coinciding with a marked decrease in sea surface temperatures in the Nordic Seas; this probably corresponds to a marked shift in forest composition at Lago Grande di Monticchio at 115.80 ka BP with an associated reconstructed decrease of ca 5  C in coldest month mean temperature. Nonetheless, forest continued to dominate at Lago Grande di Monticchio until 109.50 ka BP. Such comparisons also reveal considerable complexity in the geographical and altitudinal patterns of change in palaeovegetation during the LI; such complexity is to be expected given the parallel complexity of Holocene changes. Systematic comparisons between reconstructions of palaeoclimate are hampered by a lack of consistency in approach and in the variables reconstructed. Further insight into this complexity of palaeoclimate development during the LI requires a synthesis of the available data and application of a consistent reconstruction approach that also provides robust estimates of the uncertainty in the reconstructed values.},

                  Impacts of tephra deposition on vegetation are recorded in a series of 10 high temporal resolution absolute pollen diagrams from Lago Grande di Monticchio, each diagram spanning a single tephra deposition event during the last glacial–interglacial cycle.
                
                
                  Sediment accumulation rates determined by counting and measurement of annual laminations (“varves”) provide an accurate and precise chronology, enabling the minimum recovery time after a tephra fall to be determined.
                
                
                  In most cases, pollen accumulation rate was reduced after the tephra fall, indicating reduced vegetation productivity. Tephra deposition events also led to changes in vegetation composition, although these varied in magnitude.
                
                
                  The magnitude and duration of the impacts upon the vegetation were related to the thickness of the tephra layer deposited, the thickest layers examined ({\textgreater}250 mm) having minimum recovery times of up to a century and thicker layers generally having greater impacts upon pollen productivity and vegetation composition.
                
                
                  Tephra chemistry also influenced the persistence of the impact.
                
                
                  The nature of the prevailing vegetation prior to the tephra fall influenced the degree and persistence of the impact. Tephra layers {\textless}30 mm thick had minimum recovery times of up to 90 years when they fell on wooded steppe vegetation, whereas cold steppe recovered much more quickly, as did forest.
                
                
                  The relative sensitivity of wooded steppe was contrary to our expectations.
                
                
                  Of individual pollen taxa, Cupressaceae emerged as particularly sensitive to tephra deposition.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    . Applying absolute pollen analytical methods to a sediment record with a well‐supported and precise chronology obtained from a lake in a volcanic region where the vegetation has been subject to numerous tephra deposition events enabled us to explore the impacts of such events. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts upon individual plant taxa and of differential sensitivity of three vegetation types that have prevailed in the region during the last glacial–interglacial cycle. The influences of tephra thickness and chemistry on minimum recovery time were substantial. Our results are relevant to forecasting the potential impacts upon ecosystems of volcanic eruptions.},

An independent sedimentation-rate-based chronology provides an age of 101,530 calendar years BP for the lowermost sediments sampled. This chronology enables assessment of the rapidity of vegetation changes during the last glacial; contrary to widely held views the vegetation showed numerous large magnitude changes in periods of (150 yr. The history of vegetation and environmental changes is inferred from the palynological data. Comparison with other palynological records from southern Europe indicates that the Monticchio record reveals much greater vegetation and environmental variability than has hitherto been reported. The regionally dominant biomes have been systematically reconstructioned. Whereas forest biomes predominated during the Holocene and early-Weichselian interstadials, open \&wooded steppe' predominated during the majority of Weichselian interstadials and steppe during stadial periods including the full glacial. Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions indicate rapid, large magnitude and independent variations in the three climatic variables reconstructed * winter cold, seasonal warmth and moisture availability. These variations can be linked to variations in other Earth system components; comparisons upon the basis of their independent chronologies reveals contrasts between terrestrial and marine records that are potentially important indicators of underlying mechanisms and drivers of environmental change. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

	abstract = {The inﬂuence of the northern Atlantic and tropical monsoonal systems, as recorded by the River Nile, on the climate variability of the southeastern Mediterranean was studied in two cores taken by the R/V Marion Dufresne: one core taken SE of Cyprus representing the northern Levantine Basin (core 9501, 980 m water depth) and the other located˜ 380 km further south, represents the southeastern Levantine Basin in an area inﬂuenced by the River Nile plume (core 9509, 884 m water depth). The study was performed at relatively high resolution using several proxies: d18O of Globigerinoides ruber, sediment characteristics and index colour parameters in core sections representing the last 86 ka. A low-resolution alkenone sea surface temperature record was also measured. The time frame in both cores was mostly constrained by ‘wiggle’ matching with the nearby well-dated d18O and d13C record of the Soreq Cave, which is mainly inﬂuenced by the eastern Mediterranean water vapor. The sedimentary record of the southern core is strongly inﬂuenced by the River Nile contribution throughout the last 86 ka, as evidenced by the higher sedimentation rates compared with the northern core (20 cm/ka vs. 5 cm/ka), continuously darker sediment colour, and higher TOC values (0.6–0.9 vs. 0.25 wt\% not including sapropels). During sapropels S1 and S3, present in both cores, the inﬂuence of the River Nile became more widespread, reaching as far as Cyprus. Yet, the inﬂuence of the River Nile remained stronger in the south, as evident by the higher TOC values in the southern core throughout the entire 90 ka period and the longer duration of S1 in the southern core. An anomalous low d18O interval that is not recorded in western Mediterranean occurred between 58 and 49 ka in the Levantine Basin and is more developed in the northern core. This period correlates with D-O interstadial 14 and maximum northern hemisphere insolation during the lastglacial cycle, suggesting that the warming mainly impacted the northern Levant.},

	abstract = {The basin of Baza is located in the central area of the Betic Range (SE Spain) with a catchment area of over 4000 km2. It contains a continuous and well preserved lacustrine sedimentary record from the Late Miocene to the Middle Pleistocene. The basin encloses numerous Miocene to Pleistocene mammal fossil sites that include some of the oldest hominin occurrences in Western Europe, found at the Orce sites. The present work features the palynological analysis of sediment samples obtained from the Palominas drill core. The Palominas core cuts thorough ﬁne grained sedimentary units located in the depocenter of the basin, which contain well preserved pollen grains. The palynoﬂora found in the core is rich in herbaceous pollen, as well as Quercus and Pinus, with other tree taxa appearing in lesser quantities. Spectral analysis reveals strong climatically controlled vegetation successions. The application of the Biomization method on these assemblages allows for a reconstruction of the biome succession. The Early Pleistocene landscape was dominated by a sequence of steppe, evergreen-bushland and mixed-forest biomes. The Coexistence Approach method shows that SE Spain experienced humid periods, during which precipitations were signiﬁcantly higher than during the modern climate. These humid phases are correlated with warm interglacial periods which featured the development of open forests. Dryer phases and fully open environments are correlated with colder glacial periods. Based on the palynoﬂora a Calabrian age is suggested for the Palominas core. The ﬂora and climatic patterns identiﬁed in Baza are similar to the ones identiﬁed in Calabrian records of Southern Italy and Greece.},

The results picture a cyclic climate with a possible latitudinal aridity gradient. Warm and humid (‘interglacial’) phases would have been wetter and slightly warmer than the modern climate. During cooler and drier (‘glacial’) phases, temperature and precipitation were comparatively milder and more similar to modern ones. The favourable conditions during the humid phases may have allowed for the earliest hominin communities arriving in Europe to rapidly thrive during ‘interglacial’ periods.

	abstract = {The Guadix-Baza Basin, in SE Spain, harbors hominin fossils and lithic artifacts dated to ca. 1.4e1.3 Ma, representing the ﬁrst hominin habitat in the Iberian Peninsula and possibly in Western Europe. Recent palynological studies have described a high diversity of plant taxa and biomes existing in the basin at the time of hominin presence. However, the relationship between these hominins and their environment has not been fully explored. Two novel methodologies are developed. The ﬁrst method maps the distribution of the Early Pleistocene vegetation units based on paleobotanical and paleogeographic data. The second method assesses the availability of edible plant parts using a combination of Early Pleistocene and modern taxa lists. The resulting vegetation maps reveal a great diversity of vegetation types. During dry (glacial) periods, the vegetation of the basin was represented mostly by steppes, with the appearance of forested vegetation only in the mountainous regions. During humid (interglacial) periods, Mediterranean woodlands represented the dominant vegetation, accompanied by deciduous and conifer forests in the areas of higher altitude. The lake system present in the basin also allowed for the presence of marshland vegetation. The assessment of the availability of edible plant parts reveals that early Homo could have found a high number of resources in marshland and riparian environments throughout the year. Mediterranean woodlands and deciduous forests also provided numerous edible plant parts. During dry periods, the availability of plant resources decreased heavily, but the prevalence of marshland and riparian vegetation and of forested vegetation in the areas of higher altitude could have sustained hominin communities during harsher climatic periods. However, the disappearance of the lake system and an increase of aridity after the Mid-Pleistocene Transition and during the Middle Pleistocene probably led to an impoverishment of plant resources available to early Homo in the Guadix-Baza Basin.},

	abstract = {The Sierra Nevada of southern Spain is a landscape with a rich biological and cultural heritage. The range was extensively glaciated during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline e Laguna de Río Seco at 3020 m elevation e in a paleoecological study documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, ﬁre and climate change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that pine trees grew around the lake, and ﬁre was relatively unimportant at this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Río Seco occurred before 7800 cal yr BP. This is in contrast to lower elevation sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000 cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Río Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus, Artemisia, and others). The disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand, Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Río Seco record after ca 4000 cal yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations, ﬁre occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record conﬁrms that even remote sites were not free of direct human inﬂuence during the Holocene.},

Some changes in the vegetation may be due to small climatic changes but these were only observable indirectly in increased or released exploitation pressure on the vegetation or changes in land use. The ﬁrst major decrease in woodland cover occurred in the Second Byzantine period. More open vegetation types expanded in late Venetian times and have remained signiﬁcant components of the landscape, but there has been a regeneration of woodland cover in the last century. Vegetation changes are interpreted in terms of shifts along a continuum from woodland at one end to open garigue or steppe at the other. Conventional models of cyclical or progressive changes in vegetation are of limited application here, as many key species may be found in different growth forms in different habitats.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Anatolia forms a bridge between Europe, Africa and Asia and is influenced by all three continents in terms of climate, vegetation and human civilisation. Unfortunately, well-dated palynological records focussing on the period from the end of the classical Roman period until subrecent times are rare for Anatolia and completely absent for southwest Turkey, resulting in a lacuna in knowledge concerning the interactions of climatic change, human impact, and environmental change in this important region. Two well-dated palaeoecological records from the Western Taurus Mountains, Turkey, provide a first relatively detailed record of vegetation dynamics from late Roman times until the present in SW Turkey. Combining pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal, sedimentological, archaeological data, and newly developed multivariate numerical analyses allows for the disentangling of climatic and anthropogenic influences on vegetation change. Results show changes in both the regional pollen signal as well as local soil sediment characteristics match shifts in regional climatic conditions. Both climatic as well as anthropogenic change had a strong influence on vegetation dynamics and land use. A moist environmental trend during the late-3rd century caused an increase in marshes and wetlands in the moister valley floors, limiting possibilities for intensive crop cultivation at such locations. A mid-7th century shift to pastoralism coincided with a climatic deterioration as well as the start of Arab incursions into the region, the former driving the way in which the vegetation developed afterwards. Resurgence in agriculture was observed in the study during the mid-10th century AD, coinciding with the Medieval Climate Anomaly. An abrupt mid-12th century decrease in agriculture is linked to socio-political change, rather than the onset of the Little Ice Age. Similarly, gradual deforestation occurring from the 16th century onwards has been linked to changes in land use during Ottoman times. The pollen data reveal that a fast rise in Pinus pollen after the end of the Beyşehir Occupation Phase need not always occur. The notion of high Pinus pollen percentages indicating an open landscape incapable of countering the influx of pine pollen is also deemed unrealistic. While multiple fires occurred in the region through time, extended fire periods, as had occurred during the Bronze Age and Beyşehir Occupation Phase, did not occur, and no signs of local fire activity were observed. Fires were never a major influence on vegetation dynamics. While no complete overview of post-BO Phase fire events can be presented, the available data indicates that fires in the vicinity of Gravgaz may have been linked to anthropogenic activity in the wider surroundings of the marsh. Fires in the vicinity of Bereket appeared to be linked to increased abundance of pine forests. There was no link with specifically wet or dry environmental conditions at either site. While this study reveals much new information concerning the impact of climate change and human occupation on the environment, more studies from SW Turkey are required in order to properly quantify the range of the observed phenomena and the magnitude of their impacts.},

Secondary forest with abundant Ilex aquifolium recovered between 6650 and 6000 cal a BP, indicating moist conditions. From 5000 cal a BP, agriculture and pastoralism led to the currently fragmented landscape with sparse deciduous forests (Quercus cerris). The study suggests that evergreen broadleaved species were more important at elevations above 1000 m a.s.l. before ca. 5000 cal a BP than subsequently, which might reﬂect less human impact or warmer-than-today climatic conditions between 10 000 and 5000 cal a BP. Despite land use since Neolithic times, deciduous supra-mediterranean forests were never completely displaced from the Nebrodi Mountains, because of favourable moist conditions that persisted throughout the Holocene. Reconstructed vegetation dynamics document the absence of any pronounced mid- or late-Holocene ‘aridiﬁcation’ trend at the site, an issue which is controversially debated in Italy and the Mediterranean region.

            Multidisciplinary studies, including the examination of sedimentology, palynology, diatoms and organic matter have been undertaken on a 6 m core from Lake Abijata, Ethiopia. The bottom of this core has been dated at 1720 ± BP. Analyses have shown four distinct stages in lake evolution. Two transgressive phases that have been recognized can be correlated with other lake level evidence. The transgressions result from changing inputs from lowland and highland regions within the catchment. They are most probably related to changes in seasonal rainfall patterns.},

The climate parameters were estimated using the best modern analogue technique with an updated modern pollen-climate database composed of 2748 surface samples. The record shows two main cooling phases in the Maliq area (the Oldest and Younger Dryas) and a cooling event around 8200 years, which suggests that the forcing factors driving climate variations in the North Atlantic area since the Last Glacial period also extended their inﬂuence into the Mediterranean area. The Oldest and Younger Dryas are also characterized by an arid climate and a change in the seasonality of precipitation: the summer precipitation tends to be greater during the cooling phases than during the temperate periods. The Holocene climate is relatively stable and the values of each parameter reach their modern levels, except for an arid event between 8300 and 8100 cal BP.},

The highly diverse forest flora suggest that late-glacial forest refugia were more developed here at middle altitude, rather than at higher altitude as previously suggested. The forest developed after 9800 yr B.P., while the water level remained high in the Korçë basin until 5000 yr B.P. Different environmental conditions, characterized by lower available moisture and warmer winters, progressively took place after this date. Human activity in the Korçë basin ca. 4500 yr B.P. was coeval with conditions characterized by an increase in winter temperatures and a decrease in summer moisture.},

Temporal variations in rainfall and temperatures of the Holocene Levant are reconstructed here from pollen data recovered from a sediment core drilled at the Ein Gedi shore, applying a novel biome model based on Bayesian statistics. Our results suggest that the region was arid and warm in the early Holocene period (w10e6.5 ka cal BP), wetter and colder in the mid Holocene (6.3e3.3 ka cal BP), and drier and warmer in the late Holocene (w3.2 ka cal BP to present). These periods comprise multi-centennial climate cycles that are characterized by rapid changes in temperature and precipitation reﬂecting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and atmospheric conditions over the Atlantic Ocean. The pollen record responds within a short time interval to the climate conditions and marks rapid shifts from Mediterranean to desert environmental conditions and back in the southern Levant region. We also evaluate our results in the light of possible disturbances of the natural vegetation, e.g. the possibility of forest decrease, since the Neolithic.},

Our results show a two-phase productivity pattern within HS1 that progressed from an interval of low marine productivity between {\textasciitilde}19 and 16 kyr BP to a phase with an abrupt and large productivity increase from {\textasciitilde}16 to 15 kyr BP. The second phase is characterized by distinct heavy planktonic δ13C values and high concentrations of heterotrophic dinocysts in addition to a signiﬁcant cooling signal based on the reconstructions of past sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We conclude that productivity variations within HS1 can be attributed to a substantial shift of West African atmospheric processes. Taken together our results indicate a signiﬁcant intensiﬁcation of the North East (NE) trade winds over West Africa leading to more intense upwelling during the last millennium of HS1 between {\textasciitilde}16 and 15 kyr BP, thus leaving a strong imprint on the dinocyst assemblages and sea surface conditions. Therefore, the two-phase productivity pattern indicates a complex hydrographic setting suggesting that HS1 cannot be regarded as uniform as previously thought.},

	abstract = {Establishing phase relationships between earth-system components during periods of rapid global change is vital to understanding the underlying processes. It requires records of each component with independent and accurate chronologies. Until now, no continental record extending from the present to the penultimate glacial had such a chronology to our knowledge. Here, we present such a record from the annually laminated sediments of Lago Grande di Monticchio, southern Italy. Using this record we determine the duration (17.70 ± 0.20 ka) and age of onset (127.20 ± 1.60 ka B.P.) of the last interglacial, as reflected by terrestrial ecosystems. This record also reveals that the transitions at the beginning and end of the interglacial spanned only ≈100 and 150 years, respectively. Comparison with records of other earth-system components reveals complex leads and lags. During the penultimate deglaciation phase relationships are similar to those during the most recent deglaciation, peaks in Antarctic warming and atmospheric methane both leading Northern Hemisphere terrestrial warming. It is notable, however, that there is no evidence at Monticchio of a Younger Dryas-like oscillation during the penultimate deglaciation. Warming into the first major interstadial event after the last interglacial is characterized by markedly different phase relationships to those of the deglaciations, warming at Monticchio coinciding with Antarctic warming and leading the atmospheric methane increase. Diachroneity is seen at the end of the interglacial; several global proxies indicate progressive cooling after ≈115 ka B.P., whereas the main terrestrial response in the Mediterranean region is abrupt and occurs at 109.50 ± 1.40 ka B.P.},

The results allowed for a reconstruction of vegetation, ﬁre, and erosion dynamics in the area, implicating the role of ﬁre in vegetation turnover at 5300 (mesophilous forests replaced by sclerophyllous scrubs) and at 3200 calibrated before present (cal. BP) (more xerophytics). Cereal cultivation was apparent from the beginning of the record, during the Mid-Neolithic period. From 5300 to 3800 cal. BP, long-lasting soil erosion was associated with the presence of cereals, indicating intense land-use during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods. The decline of the agriculture signal and vegetal recolonization is likely explained by land abandonment during the Final Bronze Age. Anthropogenic markers reappeared during the Iberian period when more settlements were present. A contingency of human and environmental agencies was found at 5900, 4200, and 2800 cal. BP, coinciding with abrupt climate events, that have manifested locally in reduced spring discharge, an absence of agropastoral evidence, and a marked decline in settlement densities. This case study, covering ﬁve millennia and three climate events, highlights how past climate changes have aﬀected human activities, and also shows that people repeatedly reoccupied the coast once the perturbation was gone. The littoral zone remained attractive for prehistoric communities despite the costs of living in an area exposed to climatic hazards, such as droughts.},

	abstract = {According to radiometric dates and the current state of research, the Balearic Islands were not colonized by humans prior to c. 4420/4220 cal yr BP. Therefore, it is possible to know the natural evolution of the landscape of the Balearic Islands for the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Holocene (c. 10,000 to c. 4300 cal yr BP). This study aims to improve our understanding of the respective roles of human societies and/or climate in the transformation of vegetation cover during the Late Holocene in this Western Mediterranean archipelago. The results show the importance and control of climate oscillations in the evolution of vegetation throughout the Early and Middle Holocene. Our data clearly show that the transformation of the landscape started before the ﬁrst human settlements. In Minorca (north-eastern Gymnesian Islands), this upheaval occurred between 5825 and 4675 cal yr BP (fourth to third millennium BC), while in Majorca (the largest of the Gymnesian Islands) the transition is less well dated, oscillating between 7169 and 2535 cal yr BP. In the southern Pityusic Islands, observed changes in Ibiza are less pronounced and coincide with the 4.2 cal kyr BP climate event, synchronous with human colonization. The correlation between forest ﬁres and rapid climate events, as well as the resilience of vegetation until the Middle Ages (tenth century) in Ibiza, suggest that the evolution of climatic conditions is the preponderant parameter for explaining Holocene vegetation changes on these islands.},

	abstract = {According to radiometric dates and the current state of research, the Balearic Islands were not colonized by humans prior to c. 4420/4220 cal yr BP. Therefore, it is possible to know the natural evolution of the landscape of the Balearic Islands for the ﬁrst two-thirds of the Holocene (c. 10,000 to c. 4300 cal yr BP). This study aims to improve our understanding of the respective roles of human societies and/or climate in the transformation of vegetation cover during the Late Holocene in this Western Mediterranean archipelago. The results show the importance and control of climate oscillations in the evolution of vegetation throughout the Early and Middle Holocene. Our data clearly show that the transformation of the landscape started before the ﬁrst human settlements. In Minorca (north-eastern Gymnesian Islands), this upheaval occurred between 5825 and 4675 cal yr BP (fourth to third millennium BC), while in Majorca (the largest of the Gymnesian Islands) the transition is less well dated, oscillating between 7169 and 2535 cal yr BP. In the southern Pityusic Islands, observed changes in Ibiza are less pronounced and coincide with the 4.2 cal kyr BP climate event, synchronous with human colonization. The correlation between forest ﬁres and rapid climate events, as well as the resilience of vegetation until the Middle Ages (tenth century) in Ibiza, suggest that the evolution of climatic conditions is the preponderant parameter for explaining Holocene vegetation changes on these islands.},

	abstract = {The present study focuses on charcoal particles (a component of vegetal ashes, Bodí et al., 2014) counted during palynological analysis. The absolute frequencies of this microcharcoal have been correlated with pollen percentages of resprouts, mesic trees, Pinus or AP (arboreal pollen), in order to observe patterns in the spread of wildﬁres, dynamic changes in plant succession, and possible cyclicities in Holocene microclimatic changes. The sites selected for this work are located within the Mediterranean area of the Iberian Peninsula and in the Eivissa Balearic Islands, between 42°16′ N and 36°47′ N. Results show two brief changes in vegetation dynamics during the Holocene. The ﬁrst coincides with the 8.2 cal kyr event and marks both the beginning of Holocene dynamic changes in plant succession and the Climatic Optimum. During this ﬁrst phase, charcoal peaks coincide with minimum percentages of mesic taxa (low rainfall) and occur just before an increase of resprout taxa (taxa which grow after ﬁres). The second change happens at the {\textasciitilde}4.2 cal BP kyr event, when ﬁres are most frequent and resprout taxa increase their values compared to mesic taxa and forest cover (AP). We have also observed some differences in vegetal dynamics studied at different latitudes, which appear to be punctuated by climate or insularity. In short, (i) actual succession of Mediterranean vegetation can be recognized in the past; (ii) resilience in vegetation is more common during the ﬁrst half of the Holocene than in the recent Holocene: A trend to aridity, reduced biomass and anthropization has caused vegetation resilience to decline; (iii) synchronicity between ﬁre peaks of different sequences studied is very rare; and (iv) coincidence of many peaks of charcoal with Bond events inclines us to think that ﬁres are more conditioned by the climate than by anthropogenic impact.},

	abstract = {Few examples of natural forest remain near the Mediterranean coast. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to study how coastal forests respond to climatic change or their resilience to human impact. We developed new sedimentary record of Holocene vegetation and ﬁre history at Lago Preola, a coastal lake in southwestern Sicily (Italy). In order to verify the existence of forest at large scale on the coast, we compare pollen from Lago Preola, a medium-sized lake (33 ha), to Gorgo Basso, a small lake (3 ha) located nearby with the aim of separating local from extra-local vegetation dynamics through time using pollen percentages and inﬂux. We then compare Lago Preola pollen to the record from Biviere di Gela, a large lagoon (120 ha) situated 160 km to the east in southern Sicily, to examine differences in vegetation dynamics between the two coastal areas during the Holocene. Lake-level reconstructions and ostracode analyses from Lago Preola provide vegetation-independent evidence of climate change, and help to disentangle human and climatic impacts on vegetation. Pollen data indicate Pistacia-dominated shrublands replaced open grasslands in the region surrounding Lago Preola by 9500 cal yr BP. This change coincided with rising lake levels and the development of an ostracode fauna typical of fresh waters. Evergreen forest dominated by Quercus ilex and Olea europaea started to expand by 7000 cal BP and consolidated at 6500 cal yr BP, when lake levels were near their Holocene high. Similarities between pollen from Lago Preola and Gorgo Basso demonstrate that forest was the dominant vegetation type in coastal Sicily during the middle Holocene at both regional and local scales, and even developed in the drier climatic setting around Biviere di Gela. Lake levels fell at Lago Preola after 7000 cal yr BP, with a strong decline accompanied by increasing salinity after 4500 cal yr BP. However, no transition in vegetation matched these inferred hydrological changes. Instead, forests persisted in the surrounding region until 2200 cal BP when human disturbance intensiﬁed. We propose that different climatic factors control lake levels and vegetation in coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Whereas lake levels are most sensitive to the abundance of winter precipitation, coastal forests depend on spring precipitation and are limited by the length of summer drought. Moisture availability remained suitable for evergreen forests in coastal Sicily during the late Holocene, and humans, not a drier climate drove the regional forest decline.},

	abstract = {A new sedimentary sequence from Lago di Venere on Pantelleria Island, located in the Strait of Sicily between Tunisia and Sicily was recovered. The lake is located in the coastal infra-Mediterranean vegetation belt at 2 m a.s.l. Pollen, charcoal and sedimentological analyses are used to explore linkages among vegetation, fire and climate at a decadal scale over the past 1200 years. A dry period from ad 800 to 1000 that corresponds to the ‘Medieval Warm Period’ (WMP) is inferred from sedimentological analysis. The high content of carbonate recorded in this period suggests a dry phase, when the ratio of evaporation/precipitation was high. During this period the island was dominated by thermophilous and drought-tolerant taxa, such as Quercus ilex, Olea, Pistacia and Juniperus. A marked shift in the sediment properties is recorded at ad 1000, when carbonate content became very low suggesting wetter conditions until ad 1850–1900. Broadly, this period coincides with the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA), which was characterized by wetter and colder conditions in Europe. During this time rather mesic conifers (i.e. Pinus pinaster), shrubs and herbs (e.g. Erica arborea and Selaginella denticulata) expanded, whereas more drought-adapted species (e.g. Q. ilex) declined. Charcoal data suggest enhanced fire activity during the LIA probably as a consequence of anthropogenic burning and/or more flammable fuel (e.g. resinous Pinus biomass). The last century was characterized by a shift to high carbonate content, indicating a change towards drier conditions, and re-expansion of Q. ilex and Olea. The post-LIA warming is in agreement with historical documents and meteorological time series. Vegetation dynamics were co-determined by agricultural activities on the island. Anthropogenic indicators (e.g. Cerealiatype, Sporormiella) reveal the importance of crops and grazing on the island. Our pollen data suggest that extensive logging caused the local extinction of deciduous Quercus pubescens around ad1750.},

	abstract = {In semi-arid regions subject to rising temperatures and drought, palaeoecological insights into past vegetation dynamics under a range of boundary conditions are needed to develop our understanding of environmental responses to climatic changes. Here, we present a new high-resolution record of vegetation history and ﬁre activity spanning the last 12,000 years from Lake Sidi Ali in the southern Middle Atlas Mountains, Morocco. The record is underpinned by a robust AMS radiocarbon and 210Pb/137Cs chronology and multi-proxy approach allowing direct comparison of vegetation, hydroclimate, and catchment tracers. The record reveals the persistence of steppic landscapes until 10,340 cal yr BP, prevailing sclerophyll woodland with evergreen Quercus until 6,300 cal yr BP, predominance of montane conifers (Cedrus and Cupressaceae) until 1,300 cal yr BP with matorralization and increased ﬁre activity from 4,320 cal yr BP, and major reduction of forest cover after 1,300 cal yr BP. Detailed comparisons between the pollen record of Lake Sidi Ali (2,080 m a.s.l.) and previously published data from nearby Tigalmamine (1,626 m a.s.l.) highlight common patterns of vegetation change in response to Holocene climatic and anthropogenic drivers, as well as local differences relating to elevation and bioclimate contrasts between the sites. Variability in evergreen Quercus and Cedrus at both sites supports a Holocene summer temperature maximum between 9,000 and 7,000 cal yr BP in contrast with previous large-scale pollen-based climate reconstructions, and furthermore indicates pervasive millennial temperature variability. Millennial-scale cooling episodes are inferred from Cedrus expansion around 10,200, 8,200, 6,100, 4,500, 3,000, and 1,700 cal yr BP, and during the Little Ice Age (400 cal yr BP). A two-part trajectory of Late Holocene forest decline is evident, with gradual decline from 4,320 cal yr BP linked to synergism between pastoralism, increased ﬁre and low winter rainfall, and a marked reduction from 1,300 cal yr BP, attributed to intensiﬁcation of human activity around the Early Muslim conquest of Morocco. This trajectory, however, does not mask vegetation responses to millennial climate variability. The ﬁndings reveal the sensitive response of Middle Atlas forests to rapid climate changes and underscore the exposure of the montane forest ecosystems to future warming.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the Late Quaternary (c. 20,300–o505 cal yr BP) environmental history of Siles, a lake situated at 1320 m in the Segura mountains of southern Spain, with the goal of establishing the mechanisms exerting control on vegetation change. Palaeoecological indicators include pollen, microcharcoal, spores of terrestrial plants, fungi, and non-siliceous algae, and other microfossils. The Siles sequence is shown to be sensitive to climatic change, although the control exerted by climate on vegetation is ultimately shaped by disturbances and species interactions, determining the occurrence of century-scale lags and threshold responses. Biotically induced changes of vegetation are also shown at the intrazonal level of variation. The new sequence is placed in the context of two previous records to postulate a picture of Holocene environmental change for the Segura region. The existence of mid-elevation glacial refugia for a number of temperate and Mediterranean trees is shown. A mid-Holocene phase (c. 7500–5200 cal yr BP) emerges regionally as the time of maximum forest development and highest lake levels. The early Holocene occurs as a generally dry, pyrophytic period of pine forests, with grassland scrub in high altitudes, and the late Holocene as a period of protracted vegetation sensitivity, with return to development of pine forests, spread of xerophytic communities, and increased ﬁre activity, under the context of dry spells, localized anthropogenic disturbance, and shallowing and desiccation of lakes. Several events described here correlate with established times of abrupt transitions in the climates of northern Europe, the Mediterranean basin, north Africa, and the Sahel. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The pollen stratigraphy is used to infer past vegetation changes within a catchment area that represents the boundary between semi-arid, plateau and mountain vegetation. From c. 9700–7530 cal. yr BP, Pinus is dominant, probably as a result of a combination of a relatively dry climate and natural ﬁre disturbance. From c. 7530–5900 cal. yr BP, moderate invasion by Quercus appears to be a migrational response following increased moisture and temperature, but in part shaped by competitive adjustments. From c. 5900–5000 cal. yr BP, the pine forests are replaced by deciduous-Quercus forests with an important contribution from Corylus, Betula, Fraxinus and Alnus. Mediterranean-type forests spread from c. 5000 to 1920 cal. yr BP coincident with expansions of Artemisia, Juniperus and other xerophytes. From c. 1920–1160 cal. yr BP, Pinus becomes dominant after a disturbance-mediated invasion of the oak forests. Human impact upon the regional landscape was negligible during the Neolithic, and limited in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Local deforestation and the expansion of agro-pastoral activities occur after c. 1600 cal. yr BP.},

	abstract = {Percentage and concentration pollen diagrams are presented for two cores (taken 5 m apart) at an upper Pleistocene and Holocene site at Navarres (Valencia, eastern Spain). Chronological information is provided by an internally consistent radiocarbon dating series that extends from c. 20700 to 3075 yr BP. The results highlight the dangers of relying on a single core in interpreting the patterns of variation of particular taxa. Significant palynological differences, seemingly locational, are described between the two cores. The upper Pleistocene records accords well with the widely recognized European sequence of (a) upper Pleniglacial, (b) Bolling-Allerod warm period, and (c) Younger Dryas crisis. However, the sequence does not show disruption of vegetation patterns following the commencement of the Holocene, and Pinus continues to be dominant up to c. 5500-6000 yr BP. Later, there is evidence for Quercus forest, mesophilous trees, and xerosclerophyllous Mediterranean vegetation, which is coincident with eutrophication of the study site. These vegetation changes are discussed in the context of anthropogenic disturbance by Neolithic people, competitive exclusion, and climatic change.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a mid- to late-Holocene vegetation sequence of a Juniperus thurifera-dominated area in the eastern, continental plateaux of the Segura Mountains of southeastern Spain. A mid-Holocene maximum of mesic tress is recorded in the pollen diagram between c. 6640 and 4790 cal years BP with the vegetation dominated by deciduous oaks. A dramatic decline in deciduous oaks occurred from approximately 4700 cal years BP to be replaced initially by evergreen oak, and then junipers and other xerophytes from c. 4500 cal years BP. This trend of xericness in the vegetation is coherent with regional and extra-regional palaeoclimatic records for increased mid-Holocene aridity. Significant anthropogenic modification of the vegetation occurred in this region from c. 1350 cal years BP represented by a large reduction in all tree taxa (except Juniperus) and increases of thorny scrub and nitrophilous assemblages. Increased fire incidence, pastoralism, and arboriculture were associated with this anthropogenic activity. We conclude that present-day J. thurifera-dominated communities in this region have become established through a combination of two predominant processes; increased aridification from c.4500 cal years BP and anthropogenic activity from c. 1200 cal years BP.},

                    The fossil pollen record of Cañada de la Cruz in the Segura mountains of southern Spain yields insights into high‐elevation vegetational dynamics over the last
                    c
                    . 8320 years. Phases of xerophytic grassland alternate with high‐mountain open pine forests and expansion of deciduous forests and Mediterranean scrub at lower altitudes.
                  
                
                
                  Longer‐term stable vegetation patterns are interrupted by multidecadal to century‐scale shifts at about 7770, 3370, 2630, 1525 and 790 years BP.
                
                
                  Some of the vegetation types have no modern analogues and represent high‐altitude remnants of widespread last‐glacial xerophytic communities. Other species patterns, characteristic of current scrub associations, appeared only within the last 800 years.
                
                
                  
                    The sequence fits within the regional context of a generally wet mid‐Holocene (
                    c
                    . 7700–3300 years BP) characterized by spread of mesophilous vegetation, between drier conditions characterized by greater abundance of xerophytes.
                  
                
                
                  The pollen record and current ecological studies on high‐elevation vegetation of Mediterranean Spain suggest that control of vegetation is primarily climatic although grazing pressure, which would have pushed vegetation over a threshold for change, cannot be discounted.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a palynological sequence to examine the Holocene (8390–160 cal yr BP) environmental history of the Sierra de Baza (Granada, southeastern Spain) with the goal of establishing the mechanisms exerting control over vegetation change. During the period ca 8390–6320 cal yr BP, Pinus dominated the pollen spectra, indicating a forested landscape over the high-elevation areas of the Sierra. From ca 6320–3800 cal yr BP, an expansion of deciduous oaks and other broad-leaf trees took place. After an optimum around 5800–5600 cal yr BP, mesophytes decreased in the 3800–2560 cal yr BP interval while a ﬁre-prone scrub became established. The main loss of forest accompanied the spread of thorny matorral after ca 2560 cal yr BP. Overall, this mountain region has shown itself to be sensitive to a range of inﬂuences, among which a continental climate that has become increasingly arid over the last 5000 years, the scarcity of soils suitable for cultivation, a geology that includes sources of copper and other metals and, especially, the incidence of grazing as well as the repeated appearance of ﬁres during the last 4000 years, are highlighted. The history of the vegetation of the Sierra de Baza seems clearly inﬂuenced by changes in local economy. Here we discuss how ecological transitions have interacted with cultural changes, with emphasis on the locally highly populated Chalcolithic (5700–4400 cal yr BP) and Argaric (4400–3550 cal yr BP) periods, as well as the Iberian period (3200–2220 cal yr BP). The sierra was abandoned during the Iberian Period which was, paradoxically, when the highest human impact on mountain vegetation is noticeable.},

The local vegetation dynamics are reconstructed through the palaeoecological record obtained from a lacustrine deposit situated at 1530 m. Various hypotheses are considered to explain the vegetation dynamics apparent in the palaeoecological evidence, including climatic change, re occurrence and human activity. Although the vegetation in this region is sensitive to climatic change, threshold events driven by ecological factors are also apparent. Climatic events include a thermo-mesophytic optimum with abundance of deciduous trees and maximum lake water level found from c. 6850 to 5500 cal. yr BP. In contrast, changes in the frequency of major re episodes appear to have shaped interspeci c relationships and vegetation change, especially from c. 4200 cal. yr BP onwards. Biotic properties of the ecosystem such as the inertia of established tree populations, interconnected with competition adjustments, appear also to have played a role. Over the last two millennia, overgrazing, combined with natural and/or human-set res, appears to have pushed mountain forests over a threshold leading to the spread of grassland, thorny scrub, junipers and nitrophilous communities.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to reconstruct the impact of past environmental changes in the Moroccan Rif mountainous ecosystems. We collected an 8.5 m sedimentary core in the western part of the Rif and analyzed its palynological content, micro-remains of fossil charcoal, particle size, and content of several chemical elements. The chronology of the record is based on ten 14C datings that indicate a continuous time span of 9,000 years. This multidisciplinary approach allowed us to reconstruct both the environmental evolution of the catchment area and the vegetation dynamics in the surrounding landscape. Besides the fossil record, we collected a series of surface samples along a transect running from Talassemtane National Park, where fir populations are currently protected, to the study site in order to determine the dispersal capacity of different plant taxa. Based on the modern observations, the fossil pollen data show that despite its closer range today to the study site than Cedrus atlantica (closest populations at ca. 20 km), Abies maroccana (populations at ca. 10 km) did not reach the studied site during the Holocene. At the same time, Cedrus atlantica was present and even dominated the landscape between 8,000 and 6,000 BP. After 6,000 BP, other species more tolerant to annual drought, such as evergreen oaks, expanded gradually. The early Holocene period was wet enough to promote a maximum expansion of cedar forest. The Atlas cedar disappears from the fossil record after 2,000 BP due to an increased human pressure. Particle size analysis and chemical elements are particularly relevant for reconstructing the landscape changes and for depicting the human impact. Their changes after 2,000 BP are well correlated with the forest cover decline.},

Here we present quantitative pollen-plant diversity comparisons for a mountainous area of the Western Mediterranean region. Samples were collected between 430–1,865 m elevation and pollen-plant diversity assessed through richness and turnover (beta-diversity) metrics. We found statistically significant relationships between pollen diversity metrics and the diversity of pollen-equivalent plant taxa in the surrounding vegetation. The strongest richness relationships emerged from the exclusion of trees and with standardisation of the sample size (rarefaction) applied to both plant and pollen datasets. Three different metrics for turnover produced similar results, but emphasise different components of beta diversity (replacement vs richness differences). These results pave the way for reconstructing biodiversity trends from pollen sequences, with a number of caveats. Fossil pollen is a potentially rich source of information on past biodiversity in the Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies along the northern Mediterranean borderland have documented the use of shellfish by Neanderthals but none of these finds are prior to Marine Isotopic Stage 3 (MIS 3). In this paper we present evidence that gathering and consumption of mollusks can now be traced back to the lowest level of the archaeological sequence at Bajondillo Cave (Ma´laga, Spain), dated during the MIS 6. The paper describes the taxonomical and taphonomical features of the mollusk assemblages from this level Bj19 and briefly touches upon those retrieved in levels Bj18 (MIS 5) and Bj17 (MIS 4), evidencing a continuity of the shellfishing activity that reaches to MIS 3. This evidence is substantiated on 29 datings through radiocarbon, thermoluminescence and U series methods. Obtained dates and paleoenvironmental records from the cave include isotopic, pollen, lithostratigraphic and sedimentological analyses and they are fully coherent with paleoclimate conditions expected for the different stages. We conclude that described use of shellfish resources by Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis) in Southern Spain started ,150 ka and were almost contemporaneous to Pinnacle Point (South Africa), when shellfishing is first documented in archaic modern humans.},

Archaeological and geomorphological continental records now available for the coast of Ma´ laga complement these records for the second part of the last major glacial episode and the early stages of the Holocene. This paper provides an overview of the archaeological, chronological and palaeoenvironmental data from the end of the Middle Palaeolithic period to the Epipalaeolithic. Sequences from the two major sites, Nerja and Bajondillo, indicate a mosaic-type response of ecosystems to the rapidly shifting conditions of the Last Glacial episode. Terrestrial mammals, for example, show no major variations from present-day communities. Plant remains in contrast, demonstrates the existence of localised refuge areas for species that would not otherwise have survived in the more widely prevailing climatic conditions of the time, whereas remains of ﬁsh and, secondarily, birds demonstrate the existence of communities without any present-day analogues combining Mediterranean and Boreal (i.e., northern Atlantic) taxa. From an archaeological standpoint, the major cultural shift is the onset of marine ﬁshing, beginning in the Solutrean. This coincided with the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) episode. The faunal record also testiﬁes to the rising importance of marine resources more generally. Although the data have not been used systematically to test the validity of the Broad Spectrum Revolution (BSR) hypothesis, the hints for it in the area seem compelling from the start of the Solutrean onwards.},

	abstract = {Lake Abiyata is a small, closed, saline{\textasciicircum}alkaline lake located in the central part of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, East Africa. A multi-proxy study of a sediment core, 116 cm long and with undisturbed mud{\textasciicircum}water interface, was performed to test the sensitivity of the lake system and of different proxies to the changes in climate and human activities that occurred in the catchment during the past few centuries. The 210Pb analyses suggest that the upper 80 cm of the core represent the past 200 years. This study complements millennial-scale environmental records available in the region. The main freshwater-climatic and biological features of the modern lake system and their variations over the past decades, as known from observations, are first summarised. Results derived from individual proxies analysed along the core are then presented (successively, major physical and chemical properties of bulk sediments, diatoms and pollen). Uncertainties on the chronological framework are discussed. Major limnological stages are finally identified based on the multi-proxy interpretation of our record. Our record shows large variations in the lake water and salt balances, in the sediment sources, and in the vegetation distribution in the basin. Using our 210Pb chronology, major changes observed in the core are tentatively compared with environmental events known from instrumental and historical records. The upper 41 cm of the core (210Pb age: 1940{\textasciicircum}1998 AD) reveal several fluctuations in diatominferred water depth and salinity which seem to be consistent with known changes in water level. Human impact on vegetation clearly appears since about 30 years. The interval 85{\textasciicircum}41 cm suggests a period of overall water deficit. Lake Abiyata experienced episodes shallower and more saline than over the past decades, especially around 68{\textasciicircum}66 cm, 210Pb dated at ca. 1890 AD. This level may coincide with one of the worst droughts known in the Ethiopian history during 1888{\textasciicircum}1892. The lower part of the core includes a stage (108{\textasciicircum}85 cm) of lake level much higher than today and which ended before 1800 AD. Although its base is undated so far, this stage suggests that conditions much wetter than today have prevailed in the region during at least part of the 18th century. Lake Abiyata appears to be a suitable site for a detailed environmental reconstruction over the recent past, although further work is needed to reduce the uncertainties on our record, as discussed in the conclusions.},

The natural, pre-disturbance vegetation of the area was Podocarpus-Juniperus forest. At about 500 bc, following Semitic immigration to northern Ethiopia, the forests were cleared and replaced by a secondary vegetation of Dodonaea scrub and grassland that persisted for 1800 years. Grasslands were dominant from about ad 1200 to 1400, probably as a result of further intensi cation of grazing, perhaps exacerbated by drought. Juniperus forest, with Olea and Celtis, then expanded from ad 1400 to 1700, possibly because of drought-induced depopulation followed by increased rainfall. Deforestation and soil erosion has again intensi ed during the last three centuries. Since forest regrowth was possible after 1800 years of human impact, northern Ethiopia should again be capable of supporting forest under appropriate land management.},

The highly diverse forest flora suggest that late-glacial forest refugia were more developed here at middle altitude, rather than at higher altitude as previously suggested. The forest developed after 9800 yr B.P., while the water level remained high in the Korçë basin until 5000 yr B.P. Different environmental conditions, characterized by lower available moisture and warmer winters, progressively took place after this date.

However, distinct vegetation changes are recorded during the early Holocene. Grasslands spread soon after 9000 cal BP and reached their maximal expansion ca 8600e8000 cal BP. At about 8000 cal BP these grasslands retreated abruptly and were replaced by more drought-resistant dwarf-shrublands, similar to the present-day ecosystems. The recorded early Holocene grassland expansion furnishes for the ﬁrst time evidence of an additional and more favourable grazing resource, and thereby improved conditions for herders/hunters, during the Early Holocene in northwestern Arabia, which retreated abruptly due to aridiﬁcation at about 8000 cal BP.},

Assuming that the atmospheric circulation model of the last glacial-interglacial transition, based on snapshots of three time-slices, holds for the entire Brunhes chron, the 0-7 My-long pollen record of ODP Site 658 has been interpreted. Fluctuating percentages and influx rates of pollen of Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and savanna elements record a repeatedly shifting Saharan-Sahelianboundary between c. 14° and 23°N during the Brunhes chron. Most of the humid interglacials occured before 280 ka, and extreme glacial conditions are only found during the last 480 ka. Assumptions and possible conclusions are argued. A coherency between the pollen signal of Poaceae and that of Cyperaceae is demonstrated by cross-correlation and a distinct 42 ka periodicity suggests forcing by obliquity.},

Unfortunately, with the exception of upper Pliocene sediments from Hole 958A between 31 and 41 mbsf and one other sample at 22.25 mbsf, most of the investigated sediments being of late Pliocene and Pleistocene age showed a poor pollen preservation. Samples with good pollen preservation showed a flora dominated by pine pollen. Pollen from the Sahara was infrequently found indicating that the African Easterly Jet was very weak. The dinoflagellate cyst assemblage is typical for the oceanic environment of the North Atlantic. A hiatus between 44 and 42.50 mbsf is confirmed by the last occurrence of cysts of Invertocysta.},

Microfossil assemblages from the longest sediment core (GHA: 813 cm) record changes in local and regional vegetation and lake productivity over the last \&9500 years. Pollen spectra indicate that vegetation progressed from an open landscape with an increase in arboreal pollen occurring \&8500 BP to mixed forest comprising oak, pine and juniper until around 3000 BP (Cal \&1240 BC) when a human occupation phase becomes discernible from the pollen spectra. This occurs shortly after the deposition of a volcanic tephra layer which originated from the Minoan eruption of Santorini (Thera) and radiocarbon dated to 3330\$70 yr BP (Cal \&1600 BC). This human occupation phase is comparable to the Beys,ehir Occupation phase recorded at other sites in southwest Turkey and involved forest clearance and the cultivation of fruit trees such as Olea, Juglans, Castanea and »itis together with arable cereal growing and pastoralism. The presence of pollen types associated with the Beys,ehir Occupation phase in deposits above the Santorini tephra layer conﬁrms a Late Bronze Age/early Anatolian Dark Age date for its commencement. Since \&3000 BP notable changes in aquatic ecology associated with tephra deposition and subsequent nutrient and sediment ﬂux from the lake catchment are recorded. The Beys,ehir Occupation phase at Go¨ lhisar Go¨ lu¨ came to an end around 1300 BP (Cla AD \&700) when pine appears to have become the dominant forest tree. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Vegetation reconstructions in the Dead Sea region based on sediment records are potentially biased, because the vast majority of them derive from the western side of the sea, and only focus on large areas and time spans, while little is known about extra-local ({\textless} 1,000 m radius) to local ({\textless} 20 m radius) changes. To fill this gap, we compared a vegetation survey with modern pollen assemblages from the “Palm Terrace” oasis ca. 300 m b.s.l. (below sea level), at the eastern edge of the Dead Sea. This revealed how the oasis vegetation is reflected in pollen assemblages. In addition, two sediment cores were collected from the centre and the edge of a mire at the oasis to reconstruct past vegetation dynamics. We analysed sedimentary pollen and microscopic charcoal, as well as the sediment chemistry by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and conductivity, focusing on the past {\textasciitilde} 1,000 years. Pollen results suggest that mesophilous Phoenix dactylifera (date palm) stands and wetland vegetation expanded there around ad 1300–1500 and 1700–1900. During the past ca. 100 years, drought-adapted Chenopodiaceae gained ground, partly replacing the palms. Results from elemental analysis, especially of elements such as chlorine, provide evidence of enhanced evaporative salinization. Increasing desertification and the associated decline of mesophilous date palm stands during the past ca. 50 years is probably related to a decrease in annual precipitation and also corresponds to decreasing water levels in the Dead Sea. These have mainly been caused by increasing extraction of fresh water from tributaries and wells, mainly for local agriculture and industry. In the future, with hotter and drier conditions as well as increased use of water, oasis vegetation along the Dead Sea might be at further risk of contraction or even extinction.},

	abstract = {Coupled multiproxy indicators (pollen, stable isotopes and charcoal) reconstructed from annually laminated lake sediments from Nar Gölü in Cappadocia (central Turkey) complemented by documentary and archaeological evidence provide a detailed record of environmental changes and their causes from late Antiquity (AD 300) to the present day. Stable isotope data indicate marked shifts in the variability in summer drought intensity and winter–spring rainfall, but these did not coincide in time with changes in vegetation and land use shown by pollen data. Rather, human impacts appear to have been the main driver of landscape ecological changes in Cappadocia over the last two millennia. Pollen and charcoal data indicate four principal landuse phases: (i) an early Byzantine agrarian landscape characterized by cereals and tree crops, and marking the later part of the so-called Beys¸ehir Occupation phase; (ii) a period of landscape abandonment and the establishment of secondary woodland from AD 670 to 950 coinciding with the Arab invasions of Anatolia and marking the transition from late Antiquity to the middle Byzantine period; (iii) the re-establishment of cereal-based agriculture and pastoralism from c. AD 950, with this cultural landscape being maintained through the Byzantine ‘Golden Age’, the Seljuk and Ottoman Empires; and (iv) agricultural intensification during the late Ottoman era and the Turkish Republic (AD 1830 to present). Charcoal fluxes indicate that prior to the twentieth century, landscape burning was most frequent at times of diminished human impact when fuel biomass increased. Pollen and historical data show remarkably close agreement in terms of the timing of landscape change, and the former suggest that rural cultural traditions were able to survive largely intact through short-lived periods of sociopolitical dislocation such as the sixth century Justinian plague and the thirteenth century Mongol invasions.},

	abstract = {Intense debate surrounds the evolution of grasses using the C4 (Hatch-Slack) photosynthesis pathway and the emergence of African grasslands, often assumed to be one and the same. Here, we bring new insights with the combination of plant leaf wax carbon isotopic composition (δ13Cwax) and pollen data from marine sediments of the Gulf of Aden (northeast Africa), which show that C4 biomass increases were not necessarily associated with regional grassland expansion. We ﬁnd broadly opposing trends toward more enriched δ13Cwax values and decreased grass pollen proportions between 12 and 1.4 Ma. This apparently contradictory evidence can be reconciled if a greater proportion of the Late Miocene northeast African landscape were covered by C3 grasses than previously thought, such that C4 grasses and shrubs replaced a C3 ecosystem including trees and productive grasslands. In addition, δ13Cwax and pollen both indicate that true rainforests were unlikely to have been extensive in northeast Africa at any time in the last 12 m.y., although seasonally dry forests were a signiﬁcant component of the regional landscape since the Late Miocene. Here, we extend regionally integrative marine archives of terrestrial vegetation back to 12 Ma, and we evaluate them in the context of an updated compilation of pedogenic carbonate δ13C values from East African Rift strata. We identify two distinct phases of increasing C4 biomass between 11 and 9 Ma (with a reversal by 4.3 Ma) and then a re-expansion between 4.3 and 1.4 Ma; surprisingly, neither was associated with grassland expansion.},

Humidity increased since 14.9 ka to reach a maximum between {\textasciitilde} 9 and 7.5 ka, as revealed by peak abundances of the tropical mangrove Rhizophora and high values of a pollen-based humidity index. The HHP ended up gradually, starting to decline as soon as 7.5 ka and collapsing deﬁnitively at 4 ka. This decline is characterized by the appearance of Mediterranean taxa and the return of arid conditions, comparable to that of today. Comparison of our pollen record with three speleothem records from the Arabian Peninsula makes it possible to reconstruct a northward and westward shift of the InterTropical Convergence Zone at the onset of the HHP.},

The reliability of this record is supported by comparison with that of Padul (Sierra Nevada, Spain). Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 was characterised by ﬂuctuations in Quercus forest cover in response to Dansgaard-Oeschger climate variability. MIS 2 was characterised by the dominance of semi-desert vegetation. Despite overall dry and cold conditions during MIS 2, Heinrich events (HEs) 2 and 1 were distinguished from the last glacial maximum by more intensely arid conditions. Taxon-speciﬁc vegetation responses to a tripartite climatic structure within the HEs are observed. In MIS 1, the Bölling-Allerød was marked by rapid afforestation, while a re-expansion of semidesert environments occurred during the Younger Dryas. The maximum development of mixed Quercus forest occurred between 11.7 and 5.4 cal ka BP, with forest decline since 5.4 cal ka BP. On orbital timescales, a long-term expansion of semi-desert vegetation from MIS 3 into MIS 2 reﬂects global ice-volume trends, while Holocene arboreal decline reﬂects summer insolation decrease. The inﬂuence of precession on the amplitude of forest development and vegetation composition is also detected.},

	abstract = {In lake sediments where terrestrial macrofossils are rare or absent, AMS radiocarbon dating of pollen concentrates may represent an important alternative solution for developing a robust and high resolution chronology suitable for Bayesian modelling of age-depth relationships. Here we report an application of the heavy liquid density separation approach (Vandergoes and Prior, Radiocarbon 45:479e492, 2003) to Holocene lake sediments from karstic Lake Sidi Ali, Morocco. In common with many karstic lakes, a signiﬁcant lake 14C reservoir effect of 450e900 yr is apparent, evidenced by paired dates on terrestrial macrofossils and either aquatic (ostracod) or bulk sediment samples. AMS dating of 23 pollen concentrates alongside laboratory standards (bituminous coal, anthracite, IAEA C5 wood) was undertaken. Concentrates were prepared using a series of sodium polytungstate (SPT) solutions of progressively decreasing density (1.9e1.15 g/cm3) accompanied by microscopic analysis of the resulting residues to allow quantiﬁcation of the terrestrial pollen content. The best fractions (typically precipitating at 1.4 e1.2 g/cm3) yielded dateable samples of 0.5e5 mg (from sediment samples of {\textasciitilde}15 g), with C content typically {\textasciitilde}50\% by weight. Terrestrial pollen purity ranges from 29\% to 88\% (m ¼ 67\%), reﬂecting the challenge of isolating pollen grains from common aquatic algae, e.g. Pediastrum and Botryococcus. A Poisson-process Bayesian depositional model incorporating radiocarbon (pollen and macrofossil) and 210Pb/137Cs data is employed. As all pollen samples incorporate some non-terrestrial organic matter, we assume an exponential outlier distribution treating each pollen concentrate datum as an old outlier and terminus post quem. This approach yields strong data-model agreement, and differences between the prior and posterior age distributions are furthermore consistent with theoretical offsets anticipated for the known reservoir ages and sample-speciﬁc terrestrial content. This application of the pollen concentrate dating approach reinforces the importance of microscopic inspection of the residues during the separation and sieving stages. Sample speciﬁc differences mean that the pollen concentrate preparation cannot be reduced to a simplistic “black box” protocol, and dating and subsequent age-model development must be supported by detailed analysis of the microfossil content of the sediments.},

This paper focuses on the record of terrestrial pollen taxa, which document a series of forest expansions and declines during the period 13 000 cal. BP to 1600 cal. BP and provide insights into climate evolution in southwestern Iberia. The main vegetation phases identiﬁed in the Guadiana valley are (1) Lateglacial interstadial (Allerød) forest with Quercus and Pinus under a temperate, moist, continental climate; (2) a Younger Dryas forest decline (Quercus) and expansion of pinewoods, xeric scrub and open ground habitats (with Juniperus, Artemisia, Ephedra distachya type, Centaurea scabiosa type) under arid and cold conditions; (3) an early Holocene forest/scrub/open-ground vegetation mosaic developing under a warm, dry and continental climate; (4) a maximum of Quercus forest and thermomediterranean evergreen taxa (Olea, Phillyrea, Pistacia) reﬂecting a warm, moist oceanic climate between c. 9000 cal. BP and c. 5000 cal. BP; and (5) the expansion of shrublands with Cistaceae and Ericaceae under a drier climatic regime and increasing anthropogenic activity since c. 5000 cal. BP. Holocene episodes of maximum climatic aridity are identiﬁed in the record of xerophytic taxa (Juniperus, Artemisia, Ephedra distachya type) centred around 10 200 cal. BP, 7800 cal. BP, 4800 cal. BP, 3100 cal. BP and 1700 cal. BP. Regional comparisons suggest a correlation of arid phases across southern Iberia and northwest Africa, which can be related to abrupt North Atlantic coolings (Bond events).},

	abstract = {Pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs have been studied from three archaeological sites (8-B-10C, 8-B-76, and 8-B-81) on Sai Island, in the River Nile, and one (2-R-66) from the Amara West district, in northern Upper Nubia of the present Sudan. The research aimed at obtaining information on the environmental conditions and changes occurring in the area during the Early and Middle Holocene. Archaeologically, this is a crucial period as it saw one of the most relevant economic transitions from huntingeﬁshing egathering to animal herding. The archaeopalynological analyses are useful to reconstruct the environment and plant landscapes that supported human plant selection in this part of North Africa, between about 8700 and 4300 cal BC. However, pollen was not present everywhere because the sediments were very poor in organic content, or damaged by the repeated hydrationedehydration cycles determined by the Nile river ﬂoodings. The data obtained, the most consistent from any archaeological site in this area, are coherent with the regional and interregional palaeoenvironmental data. The interdisciplinary studies that allowed the correct interpretation of the pollen records presented in this paper included the archaeological features, and the faunal (mainly gastropod) and algal remains from the same sites. The state of preservation of most pollen, showing thinned exine, and the remarkable records of the terrestrial alga Fritschiella outline the seasonality of the area that has been evident in the past as in the present. Pollen samples included prevailing amounts of grasses and sedges that, with some hygro-hydrophilous taxa, largely represent the riverine and wetland vegetation of the Nile Valley. They suggest that the land use was not intensive and was not able to substantially modify the natural cover and cyclic renewal of the soils and the vegetation. The interdisciplinary evidence from the Sai Island, showing that site 8-B-76 has been continuatively occupied during the 8.2 ka BP dry phase, proves the key role played by the great river on attracting humans and supplying resources even, and especially, during the arid oscillations of the Holocene.},

	abstract = {The paper reports on a synthesis of pollen analyses and main archaeobotanical studies carried out on Early, Middle and Late Holocene sites from Sai Island in the Nile River (ancient Upper Nubia, present northern Sudan). Multidisciplinary archaeological studies focused on the transitions from hunting-ﬁshinggathering to pastoralism and later to agro-pastoralism in this area. New palynological data were obtained from two sites located on the eastern side of the island: an Early Holocene occupational level of a ‘Khartoum Variant’ foraging site (8-B-10C, Level 2; c. 7600–7200 BC), and a Middle/Late Holocene site dating to the Pre-Kerma/Kerma period (8-B-10A; the later phase is dated c. 1800–1600 BC). These data integrate the results obtained from two other sites located on the western side of the island (sites 8-B-76 and 8-B-81). Despite the poor preservation of pollen, the integration of data from the studied sites provides information on the environmental changes and potential for plant exploitation in the eastern Sahelian-Saharan region. A substantial environmental diversity between the west and east sides of Sai Island emerges, revealing that in the late Early Holocene and ﬁrst part of the Middle Holocene the land near the river was characterised by a mosaic of habitats, with dramatic ﬂoods on the eastern side and seasonal dried-up areas on the western side. This region supplied water even during the dry climatic phases and provided humans with mosaic habitats within short distances, giving access to plants (useful for food and other purposes) which lived in swamps and marshes, wooded savannahs, grasslands or desert savannahs.},

Our study conﬁrms that the Little Ice Age was a period of increased dryness. This resulted in the disappearance of tropical trees that were developed in gallery forests during the Holocene humid period. However, freshwater inputs from the Senegal River remained constant during the whole millennium while being strongly impacted by sea level variations: An episode of sea level rise, already recorded in the Ferlo River valley, led to a supply of salt waters up to 1250 CE. It was only after 1720 CE that a dramatic event occurred with the massive development of marine to brackish diatoms at the expense of freshwater forms as a result of the weakening of the Senegal River inputs. Increased dry conditions during the second half of the 18th and the 19th centuries culminating 1826 CE led to the salinization of the core site with the development of Avicennia populations and halophilic plant species from the rear mangrove.},

This region offered a natural laboratory for the study of human/climate interaction as the range of environmental change extended from flood to drought, forcing people to cope with periodic environmental instability. When the tropical rainfall belt migrated northward, watertable outcropped in interdunal depressions and formed permanent lakes, which alternated with severe arid spells. As a case study, this paper presents the results of interdisciplinary investigations on climate changes, human adaptations and subsistence strategies at Gobero, in the southern Sahara of Niger. Gobero is a restricted archaeological area comprising 8 sites that surround the shores of a palaeolake. It was intermittently occupied between about 9500 cal years BP and 4500 BP. Due to alternating environmental conditions it could only be occupied at the beginning and at the end of the most humid periods.},

The earlier phase, which corresponds to the Atlantic period of Firbas, is characterized by mixed deciduous woodlands with Quercus or Tilia the main components. This is followed by the phase (Subboreal) in which coniferous woodlands, which consisted of Abies and Pinus, dominated. In this time, Fagus gradually expanded. In the final phase (Subatlantic), Abies becomes more or less extinct and Fagus has a dominant role. These developments broadly correspond with those recorded in pollen profiles from Central Europe.},

	abstract = {Cucú cave is a small cavity, 1600 m above sea level on the southern slope of Sierra de María (Almería Province, SE Spain), where current mean annual precipitation is b 450 mm. Fossils and palynomorphs contained within a sedimentary sequence, up to 9 m in depth, allow us to consider the prevailing climatic conditions, and the timing of cavern development. The lithological sequence is dominated by clast-supported detrital material with no evidence of alluvial transport. These sediments were formed by freeze-cracking during periglacial conditions, causing further cave enlargement after initial solutional development. The clastic sequence formed during cold climates is covered by a ﬂowstone that was deposited during a period of warmer, wetter conditions. This provides a minimum U–Th isochron age of 40.2± 4.5 ka for the timing of periglacial action. Micromammal fossil species indicate a chronology between 140 and 80 ka. Paleoecological data based on the structure of the mammal community indicates that cold conditions prevailed at the time of deposit. In the studied sequence the presence of anthropogenic components has not been documented. The pollen assemblages identiﬁed are a common feature of Pleistocene cold stages that are in semi-arid regions.},

Lake Rkiz was exposed to marine waters from 10 to 4 ka: a brackish lagoon developed at 10 ka, followed by a mangrove between 8.7 and 7 ka both in a calm environment. Rhizo­ phora populations were never developed, however, either because they did not reach the core site at the northern extremity of the lake, or because they were restricted to the Senegal River bed. After 7 ka, the environment became increasingly unstable and the mangrove was replaced by a more clearly marine environment. During the last two millennia, a new, discrete phase of marine intrusion is recorded at Lake Rkiz. Contemporary to that already noted in the Ferlo River valley which feeds the Senegal River through Lake Guiers to the south, it also testifies to a positive oscillation of the sea level. The evolution of the regional vegetation of Lake Rkiz follows that of North tropical Africa with the expansion of a gallery forest of tropical humid affinity dominated by Celtis during the AHP. As elsewhere in the Sahara and Sahel, tropical plant types co-occurred with Saharan ones attesting to a mosaic-like landscape.},

Two Holocene records retrieved in the Aammiq and Chamsine/Anjar wetlands, respectively located at the foothills of Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountain, in the Southern Bekaa Valley, were analyzed to highlight climatic vs. anthropogenic inﬂuence on landscape patterns. Our data records support hypothesis on climatically driven modiﬁcation during the Late Glacial Age and the early Holocene. Human disturbances in the study area are only depicted after c. 8 ky cal. BP, with different patterns in eastern and western parts of the Southern Bekaa Valley. These modiﬁcations are in line with major landscape changes in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Since c. 8 ky cal. BP, major deforestation events on Mount Lebanon are recorded in the Aammiq area depicting human interference, while in Chamsine/ Anjar, no sign of such activities can be interpolated since strong deciduous oak development is recorded. Archaeological records from the same region conﬁrm human impact on the forest during the Neolithic period. Numerous bifacial ﬂint tools, such as axes, adzes, and chisels, manufactured in the prehistoric workshops of the Southern Bekaa Valley, attest to the beginning of the deforestation during this period. From c. 3.5 to c. 2 ky cal. BP, deforestation seems reduced on Mount Lebanon while in the Chamsine/ Anjar area oak forest expansion is still recorded. During the same period, grazing activities were performed in the Bekaa Valley.},

	abstract = {During most of the Holocene, the Faiyum Depression in Middle Egypt was connected to the Nile River and contained an extensive freshwater lake. Geochemical analysis of a lacustrine sediment core (Qaru-9) from the depression provides evidence of changes in Nile sediment discharge related to changes in Ethiopian African Monsoon (EAM) precipitation, and allows us to reconstruct changes in Nile River runoﬀ, vegetation and erosion in both the near and far catchment. Major and trace elements reveal signiﬁcant changes in clastic sediment provenance, with sources oscillating between (i) a Blue/Atbara Nile ﬂuvial contribution during the African Humid Period (AHP) and in the late Holocene (i.e. c. 10–7.5 \& c.4–0 ka cal BP, respectively), (ii) a White Nile contribution between c. 7.5–4 ka cal BP with aeolian contributions and carbonate deposits occurring during local arid and wetter conditions, respectively. We also use geochemical data to assign variations in the paleowater properties of the Faiyum Lake (i.e. redox condition, paleosalinity and paleoproductivity) throughout the Holocene. Changes in pollen and algal remains in early to mid Holocene sediments conﬁrm a deep freshwater lake prior to c. 10–8 ka cal BP but diminishing water levels after this period. The Faiyum Lake was a deep freshwater lake between 10 \& 6 ka cal BP with ﬂuctuating lake levels between 6–4 ka cal BP and during the late Holocene. In the later period, an abrupt drop in lake level occurred followed by increasing salinity as hydrological modiﬁcations occurred.},

Our investigations provide new insights into our understanding of the source of the Holocene Nile sediments, local palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment of the ﬂoodplain at Saqqara as well as the Holocene palaeoclimatic variations at the Nile headwaters. We also investigate the relationship between Nile ﬂoods and global climate changes and the impact of changing ﬂood conditions on episodes of societal and central governmental collapse at the end of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. The Holocene sequences recorded in two shallow drill cores (SAQA 21 and 22) were investigated and subdivided into six sedimentary units, from underlying Late Pleistocene sand and gravels (unit I) to overlying modern soil (unit VIII). Early Holocene sediments were essentially missing in the studied cores, probably due to intensive erosion during the well-known 8.2 kyr cal BP arid event. Middle Holocene sediments are represented by unit II, which reﬂect high Nile ﬂoods of Equatorial African origin with less contribution from Ethiopian sources. The Old Kingdom sediments (unit III), seems to be mainly of White Nile sources with frequent contributions from the Blue Nile. Late Holocene sediments (unit IV-VII) show an increased contribution from Blue Nile River sources. Low Nile ﬂow episodes were recorded at 5.2 (between units II and III), 4.2 (between units III and IV), 3.5 (within unit IV) and 2.7 kyr cal BP (between units V and VI). The second event corresponds to the First Intermediate Period (FIP) and the third probably coincides with the Second Intermediate Period (2nd IP), periods of disorder in Egypt.},

The age of the surface sediments at some selected sites in the estuaries, locally known as khawrs and qurms, ranges from 750 to 390 calendar years (cal y) BC to Present. Geomorphological data suggest that prior to 270 – 420 cal y AD these estuaries were open to the sea and received a high input of fresh water from the mountains. At least from 270-420 cal y AD onwards, the physiography of the estuaries changed as a consequence of dwindling fresh water input from the mountains. As a result, the open estuaries changed into barrier dominated estuaries with periodical input of saline and fresh water. Palynological data indicate that the estuaries are mainly filled with (i) pollen and spores from the surrounding vegetation; (ii) a regional input of pollen and spores through surface and subsurface runoff from mountains, coastal plain and, wadis; (iii) pollen and spores from East Africa and the Indian subcontinent brought in by the monsoon. Between 750 – 390 cal y BC and 270 – 420 cal y AD the local input of khawr taxa prevailed whereas from 270 – 420 cal y AD to Present coastal plain and wadi taxa prevail. Both geomorphological and palynological data suggest the ancient centers of trade such as Samhuram at Khawr Rawri (ca. 100 BC –100 AD) and Zafar at Khawr Al Balid (12th – 15th centuries AD) were affected by important hydrological changes related to desertification of the region as a consequence of a weakening SW (summer) monsoon.},

	abstract = {Arid regions are especially vulnerable to climate change and land use. More than one-third of Earth’s population relies on these ecosystems. Modern observations lack the temporal depth to determine vegetation responses to climate and human activity, but paleoecological and archaeological records can be used to investigate these relationships. Decreasing rainfall across the Late Holocene provides a case study for vegetation response to changing hydroclimate. Rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) middens preserve paleoenvironmental indicators in arid environments where traditional archives are unavailable. Pollen from modern middens collected in Dhofar, Oman, demonstrates the reliability of this archive. Pollen, stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N), and microcharcoal data from fossil middens reveal changes in vegetation, relative moisture, and fire from 4000 cal yr BP to the present. Trees limited to moister areas (e.g., Terminalia) today existed farther inland at ∼3100 cal yr BP. After ∼2900 cal yr BP, taxa with more xeric affiliations (e.g., Senegalia) had increased. Coprophilous fungal spores (Sporormiella) and grazing indicator pollen revealed an amplified signal of domesticate grazing at ∼1000 cal yr BP. This indicates that trees associated with semiarid environments were maintained in the interior desert during ∼3000–4000 yr of decreasing rainfall and that impacts of human activity intensified after the transition to a drier environment.},

At Awaﬁ, Ras al-Khaimah, UAE, a 3.3 m lake sediment sequence records the vegetation development for the period 8500 cal. yr BP to \$ 3000 cal. yr BP.  13C isotope, pollen and phytolith analyses indicate that C3 Pooid grassland with a strong woody element existed during the early Holocene (between 8500 and 6000 cal. yr BP) and became replaced by mixed C3 and C4 grasses with a strong C4 Panicoid tall grass element between 5900 and 5400 cal. yr BP. An intense, arid event occurred at 4100 cal. yr BP when the lake desiccated and was inﬁlled by Aeolian sand. From 4100 cal. yr BP the vegetation was dominated by C4 Chloridoid types and Cyperaceae, suggesting an incomplete vegetation cover and Aeolian dune reactivation owing to increased regional aridity.

The sequence starts at 6800 B.P. (5700 cal B.C.). The lowest part of the pollen diagram shows a period of open deciduous oak woods, which may have been influenced by human impact already (Zone I). It is followed by a period of dense deciduous oak woods (Zone II), which lasted until the beginning of the Bronze Age ca. 4800 B.P. (3500 cal B.C.). Later, the diagram indicates strong human influence such as woodland clearance, the spread of maquis, phrygana and pine in Zones IIIa-IV. During the Archaic, Geometric and Classical periods after ca. 2700 B.P. (800 cal B.C.) there is evidence of a phase of extensive olive farming (Zone IIIb). In the same zone, after a period of scattered finds, there is an almost continuous Juglans curve. Zone IV is characterised by high pine values. In Zones I-II the evidence of evergreen Mediterranean plants is surprisingly small. In times with no discernible human influence (Zone II), deciduous oaks dominate, with no evidence for a climax vegetation of the Oleo-Ceratonion alliance. Olea europaea is the only species of that alliance traceable by its pollen in the diagram, while Ceratonia pollen is totally absent.},

At ca. 6300 B.C. an expansion of Carpinus orientalis/Ostrya can be observed. Around ca. 5300 B.C. spreading of Erica indicates a change to a drier climate and/or first human impact. Since ca. 3500 B.C. an increase of evergreen shrubs now clearly indicates land-use. The foundation of the Classical city of Palairos led to a temporary expansion of Phillyrea maquis. Within this period, molluscs of brackish water indicate the use of the lake as a harbour after the construction of a connection to the sea.

	abstract = {Abstract. A high-resolution pollen record from Lago Trifoglietti in Calabria (southern Italy) provides new insights into the paleoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes which characterise the Holocene period in the southern Italy. The chronology is based on 11 AMS radiocarbon dates from terrestrial organic material. The Holocene history of the vegetation cover shows the persistence of an important and relatively stable Fagus forest present over that entire period, offering a rare example of a beech woodstand able to withstand climate changes for more than 11 000 yr. Probably in relation with early Holocene dry climate conditions which affected southern Italy, the Trifoglietti pollen record supports a southward delay in thermophyllous forest expansion dated to ca. 13 500 cal BP at Monticchio, ca. 11 000 cal BP at Trifoglietti, and finally ca. 9800 cal BP in Sicily. Regarding the human impact history, the Trifoglietti pollen record shows only poor imprints of agricultural activities and anthopogenic indicators, apart from those indicating pastoralism activities beneath forest cover. The selective exploitation of Abies appears to have been the strongest human impact on the Trifoglietti surroundings. On the basis of (1) a specific ratio between hygrophilous and terrestrial taxa, and (2) the Modern Analogue Technique, the pollen data collected at Lago Trifoglietti led to the establishment of two palaeoclimatic records tracing changes in (1) lake depth and (2) annual precipitation. On a millennial scale, these records give evidence of increasing moisture from ca. 11 000 to ca. 9400 cal BP and maximum humidity from ca. 9400 to ca. 6200 cal BP, prior to a general trend towards the drier climate conditions that have prevailed up to the present. In addition, several successive centennial-scale oscillations appear to have punctuated the entire Holocene. The identification of a cold dry event around 11 300 cal BP, responsible for a marked decline in timberline altitude and possibly equivalent to the PBO, remains to be confirmed by further investigations verifying both chronology and magnitude. Two cold and possibly drier Boreal oscillations developed at ca. 9800 and 9200 cal BP. At Trifoglietti, the 8.2 kyr event corresponds to the onset of cooler and drier climatic conditions which persisted until ca. 7500 cal BP. Finally, the second half of the Holocene was characterised by dry phases at ca. 6100–5200, 4400–3500, and 2500–1800 cal BP, alternating with more humid phases at ca. 5200–4400 and ca. 3500–2500 cal BP. Considered as a whole, these millennial-scale trends and centennial-scale climatic oscillations support contrasting patterns of palaeohydrological changes recognised between the north- and south-central Mediterranean.},

            A common belief is that, unlike today, ancient urban areas developed in a sustainable way within the environmental limits of local natural resources and the ecosystem's capacity to respond. This long-held paradigm is based on a weak knowledge of the processes underpinning the emergence of urban life and the rise of an urban-adapted environment in and beyond city boundaries. Here, we report a 6000-year record of environmental changes around the port city of Akko (Acre), Israel, to analyse ecological processes and patterns stemming from the emergence and growth of urban life. We show that early urban development deeply transformed pre-existing ecosystems, swiftly leading to an urban environment already governed by its own ecological rules and this, since the emergence of the cities.},

Corresponding with the 4.2 to 3.9 and 3.5 to 2.5 cal kyr BP abrupt climate changes (ACCs), two large-scale shifts to a more arid climate have been recorded. These two ACCs had different impacts on the vegetation assemblages in coastal Syria. The 3.5 to 2.5 cal kyr BP ACC is drier and lasted longer than the 4.2 to 3.9 cal kyr BP ACC, and is characterized by the development of a warm steppe pollen-derived biome (1100–800 B.C.) and a peak of hot desert pollen-derived biome at 900 B.C.

During this period, land clearance with multiple ﬁre episodes, intensive agricultural practices and grazing pressure profoundly altered the pre-existing warm mixed forest. Increasing moisture availability since cal. \$280 BC has acted as a trigger to crop cultivation and mountain-adapted arboriculture starting with Juglans regia during the Beys-ehir Occupation Phase. Pollen from olive groves have been recorded above 1400 m a.s.l. only at cal. \$23 BC and have disappeared deﬁnitively at cal. AD \$294. During this phase, the sediment accumulation rate was extremely high, reﬂecting landscape instability. From cal.

	abstract = {Climate change and water availability in the Middle East are important in understanding human adaptive capacities in the face of long-term environmental changes. The key role of water availability for sedentary and nomad populations in these arid to semiarid landscapes is understood, but the millennium-scale influence of hydrologic instability on vegetation dynamics, human occupation, and historic land use are unknown, which has led to a stochastic view of population responses and adaptive capacities to precipitation anomalies. Within the time-frame of the last two global climate events, the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, we report hydrologic instability reconstructed from pollen-derived climate proxies recovered near Tell Leilan, at the Wadi Jarrah in the Khabur Plains of northeastern Syria, at the heart of ancient northern Mesopotamia. By coupling climate proxies with archaeological-historical data and a pollen-based record of agriculture, this integrative study suggests that variability in precipitation is a key factor on crop yields, productivity, and economic systems. It may also have been one of the main parameters controlling human settlement and population migrations at the century to millennial timescales in the arid to semiarid areas of the Middle East. An abrupt shift to drier conditions at ca. AD 1400 is contemporaneous with a change from sedentary village life to regional desertion and nomadization (sheep/camel pastoralists) during the preindustrial era in formerly Ottoman realms, and thereby adds climate change to the multiple causes for Ottoman Empire “decline.”},

The pollen-derived climatic proxy inferred from a 315 cm deep core of alluvial deposits suggests that a shift towards wetter climatic conditions occurred from circa (ca.) 1000 to 1250 calibrated (cal) yr AD. This period is situated within the time frame of the Medieval Climate Anomaly. The reconstructed temperature trends show that the warming during this medieval episode was not as high as the modern scores, except for short intervals during the early 12th century AD. The core also recorded a shift towards drier conditions starting during the late 12th century AD, which represents the Eastern Mediterranean expression of the European “Great Famine” climatic event. The main dry and cool interval recorded in coastal Syria occurred from ca. 1520 to 1870 cal yr AD, a time frame encompassing the Little Ice Age. In Mediterranean Syria, the Little Ice Age is not only cooler, but also much drier than the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the present-day climate. Despite a strong human presence in coastal Syria throughout the last millennia, climate rather than anthropogenic activity seems to be the driving force behind the natural vegetation dynamics in this region.},

Iconic Egyptian bas-reliefs and graphic hieroglyphic and cuneiform texts portray the proximate cause of the collapse as the invasions of the ‘‘Peoples-of-the-Sea’’ at the Nile Delta, the Turkish coast, and down into the heartlands of Syria and Palestine where armies clashed, famine-ravaged cities abandoned, and countrysides depopulated. Here we report palaeoclimate data from Cyprus for the Late Bronze Age crisis, alongside a radiocarbon-based chronology integrating both archaeological and palaeoclimate proxies, which reveal the effects of abrupt climate change-driven famine and causal linkage with the Sea People invasions in Cyprus and Syria. The statistical analysis of proximate and ultimate features of the sequential collapse reveals the relationships of climate-driven famine, seaborne-invasion, region-wide warfare, and politico-economic collapse, in whose wake new societies and new ideologies were created.},

Four phases of local and extra-local fire periods have been recorded at 2320–2240, 1985–1970, 1865–1820 cal yr BP and post-AD 1950. The fire history established for the BO Phase is complex, with fire periods alternating with periods without local fires, as is the case for the late BO Phase from 1820 until 1550 cal yr BP. It is suggested that the past agricultural practices including fires cause a higher soil erodibility than agricultural practices without fires. A climatic shift towards aridity during Roman times may have triggered the observed change in fire regime but local processes, mainly human disturbances, appear to be the proximal cause of all recorded changes. In the Bereket surroundings, fires led to a simplification of the vegetation structure, favouring soil erosion, pastures and intensive cultivation.},

          , 
            Global climate change has sharpened focus on the social and economic challenges associated with water deficits, particularly in regions where anthropogenic demands exceed supply. This modern condition was also experienced by the people of ancient western Asia, where chronic water shortages were accentuated by recurrent droughts. However, human societies may react to climate change, particularly desiccation, in different ways depending on specific local conditions. Focusing on the biblical site of Tel Dan (present-day Israel), we show the effects of severe precipitation decline in an environment that was well watered and fertile even in times of drought. Such local niches of prosperity became attractive targets for predation when food resources became scarce in surrounding rain-fed areas. We propose that predation forced urban populations to either flee or adopt new subsistence strategies. Predation and abandonment, even if only partial, led to the poor maintenance of water networks in and around the city. Once stagnant water surrounded the area, water-borne disease proliferated. Our study shows how climate changes can disrupt social and political structures, cause water system management to collapse, and facilitate marshland expansion.},

	abstract = {This research aims to improve the knowledge of the mid to late Holocene climate changes and the underlying drivers in the eastern Mediterranean. We focus on the Peloponnese peninsula, SW Greece, characterized by a WE rainfall/temperature gradient and a strong climate-sensitivity to shifts in the large-scale atmospheric patterns. A radiocarbon-dated sediment core, taken from the ancient Lake Lerna, a former lake in NE Peloponnese, was analyzed for distribution and hydrogen isotope (δD) composition of n-alkanes and bulk organic geochemistry (δ13C, TOC). The predominantly macrophyte (submerged/ﬂoating)-derived δD23 proﬁle exhibits the largest long-term ﬂuctuation in the record and co-varies with δD of long-chain n-alkanes providing evidence for precipitation and temperature changes over the last 5000 years. The Lerna δD23 signal is sometimes in agreement with other n-alkane δD records from SW Peloponnese indicating wetter conditions in the peninsula at ca 5000–4600, ca 4500–4100, ca 3000–2600 (more unstable in SW) and after ca 700 cal BP with drier periods at ca 4100–3900 and ca 1000–700 cal BP. Conversely, a NE-SW climate see-saw is revealed at ca 4600–4500, ca 3200, ca 2600–1800, and ca 1200–1000 cal BP when the δD23 Lerna exhibits more positive trends (drier in NE) with a reversal at ca 3900–3300, ca 3200–3000 and ca 1800–1300 cal BP. These opposing and sometimes similar signals between NE and SW Peloponnese can be explained by the relative dominance of high-latitude atmospheric patterns over the peninsula. A similar signal would be expected when the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) exerts the main control with NAO (+) creating conditions of reduced moisture. The dipole pattern is likely driven by shifts in North Sea–Caspian Atmospheric pattern (NCP), which account for the present-day regional climate variability with NCP (+) leading to wetter and colder conditions in NE Peloponnese. The Asian monsoonal system likely has an additional impact on the δD variabilities through inﬂuencing the summer temperatures. There is a consistency between the Peloponnesian δD signals and monsoonal records after ca 4000 cal BP conﬁrming the actualistic models. Strong monsoonal periods coincide with cooler summers (lower δD values) in Lerna, due to the northerly winds, the Etesians. On the contrary, SW Peloponnese is dominated by warmer conditions during the same periods as the area is located on the lee side of the mountain and highly inﬂuenced by the adiabatic warming associated with the subsidence over the Eastern Mediterranean.},

In this study, we used the palynological method in order to shed light on the region’s demographic history in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Fifty-four samples of pollen were collected and analyzed from secure archaeological contexts in four Negev Highlands sites: Nahal Boqer 66, dated to the Early Bronze Age and Early Intermediate Bronze Age (ca. 3200–2200 BCE); Ein Ziq, dated to the Early Intermediate Bronze Age (ca. 2500–2200 BCE); Mashabe Sade, dated to the Intermediate Bronze Age (ca. 2500–2000 BCE); and Haroa, dated to the Iron Age IIA (ca. late 10th through 9th centuries BCE). Our study revealed no evidence of cereal cultivation, with some hints that the inhabitants’ diets may have included plants gathered from the wild. Only one of the sites, Nahal Boqer 66, showed micro-indicators of animal dung remains, suggesting that the inhabitants herded animals. The palynological evidence did, however, emphasize that the livestock there were not fed or supplemented with agricultural by-products but rather grazed freely on wild vegetation. The pollen data also suggest that all four sites were occupied only during late winter and spring. The activity in the Negev Highlands during the third millennium BCE was probably related to the copper industry in the Arabah and to copper transportation to settled neighboring lands, especially Egypt. A relatively humid climate supported the trade through the Negev Highlands. Deterioration in both climate conditions and settlement activity was documented in the second half of the Intermediate Bronze Age.},

	abstract = {Pollen data from a radiocarbon-dated lake-sediment core from the Middle Atlas of Morocco show that forests of evergreen and winter-deciduous oaks (Quercus rotundifolia, Q. canariensis), present from the start of the Holocene, were invaded at 6200 BP by Cedrus atlantica in low numbers. Two thousand years later, after a short period characterized by higher deciduous oak frequency, Cedrus increased to its present abundance. These changes may have been in response to increasing effective moisture as summer temperatures decreased with declining northern-hemisphere seasonality, under the influence of precessional forcing. Palaeolimnological data from the same core show that the lake level fell sharply in five 200-400 yr-long arid intervals, but the pollen data show little or no evidence of a vegetational response. This suggests that summer (growing-season) rainfall remained adequate during the dry intervals, whereas depletion of the groundwater aquifer was the result of reduced winter precipitation. Anthropogenic exploitation since c. 1300 BP has had a greater effect on the forest ecosystem than any of the Holocene arid intervals.},

At the principal site, Nisi Fen, six cores from the thickest surficial peat deposits have yielded a detailed, composite, AMS 14C-dated pollen record covering the period from 20000 cal. BP almost to the presentday. Cores Kp-4 and Bor-3 were taken from small mires at high elevations in the Boras mountains, a few kilometres to the north of Nisi, in which peat has been accumulating since the mid-Holocene. Our results show that only Pinus expanded significantly during the Lateglacial Interstadial, although small thermophilous tree populations were present in the region. The Younger Dryas chronozone is at best marked by subtle vegetational change in favour of steppe taxa. Tree cover increased rapidly at the beginning of the Holocene, with deciduous woodland probably expanding above its present-day altitudinal limits. There is evidence for drier and/or warmer summers, and mild winters, between c. 10500 and 7500cal. BP, although the vegetation was not as markedly sclerophyllous as at many sites elsewhere in Greece. The mid-Holocene saw a reorganization of the woodland, with first Abies and then Fagus becoming important at high altitudes, and an increase in the diversity of deciduous woodland at medium elevations. The suggestion of human impact in the form of a decline in woodland and the appearance of crops in the pollen record can be found at all altitudes in the later Holocene.},

In the same cores detailed palaeomagnetism, biostratigraphy, sedimentology and stable isotopes provided a chronology based on the cyclic forcing by the astronomical parameters. The period previous to 3.5 Ma corresponds to a warmer and wetter climate from {\textasciitilde}orthwestern Europe as far south as equatorial West Africa. Long term variation shows a first step towards a drier climate between 3.5 and 3.2 Ma. At 3.2 Ma, the pollen record establishes the aridification of northwestern Africa probably in connection with enhanced Trade winds. This phase may correspond to a preliminary stage of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Spectral analyses show a positive correlation between low deep sea temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean and aridity in northwestern Africa. After a period of reestablished humidity, a second and stronger step to aridification started at ca. 2.6 Ma. Before that date, there is a northern emplacement of savannah and tropical forest that probably shifted southwards afterwards. Already from 2.8 Ma, a reduction of savannah vegetation took place, probably as a result of the development of a desert in West Africa. However, mean percentages of steppe elements of North Africa are five times lower during the Pliocene than during the Late Pleistocene indicating that arid periods were still less prolonged and/or less severe during the Late Pliocene. Spectral analyses suggest that forcing of the climate by obliquity started after or ca. 2.6 Ma.},

Multiproxy analyses (lithology, loss-on-ignition, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility and palynology) of a 586-cm-long sediment core taken in the centre of the lake revealed a complex history of at least ﬁve mass-movement events. The radiocarbon chronology suggests that the sediment sequence spans approximately the last 1500 years. The bottom metre of the sequence, before c. AD 580, is a gley soil resulting from a large sublacustrine landslide, whose origin is a collapse of the ﬂoodplain between the lake and River Sakarya. Sedimentation related to this eastern ﬂoodplain decreases progressively until c. AD 910. Sedimentological and palynological indicators from sediments younger than c. AD 910 document four major episodes of mass-movement originating most likely from the southern slopes of the lake. The landslide and the following four mass-movement events are suggested to be linked to earthquakes.},

	abstract = {High-resolution palynological analysis of a 38-cm long core collected from Lake Sapanca, northwest Turkey, reveals large earthquakes that occurred during the second half of the 20th century along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. Four events have disturbed the lacustrine sedimentary sequence. Three of the four events are historical earthquakes in 1999 in Izmit, 1967 in Mudurnu and 1957 in Abant. These events are recorded in the core by turbiditic deposits and reworked sediment and by low overall palynomorph concentrations but high values of thick-exined pollen, fern spores and fungal spores. Palynomorphs in the event beds have been grouped based on their associations in modern moss, river and lake samples. The inferred mechanisms of transport and sources for the palynomorphs are: 1- lake sediment displaced by slump, 2- collapsed shoreline sediment owing to seiche, waves and sudden lake level changes, 3- subsidence of deltas and 4- river-transported soil and sediment from upland areas. The 1999 Izmit earthquake is only weakly recorded by palynomorphs, probably due to recent engineering control on the rivers. The 1967 Mudurnu earthquake had the strongest effect on the lake, introducing successive packages of sediment to the centre of the lake from underwater slopes, the lakeshore and rivers.},

Kro¨pelin provides a unique, continuous sedimentary sequence of late Holocene age available in the entire Saharan desert. Here we present pollen data and climate simulations using the LMDZ atmospheric model with a module representing the climatologically-relevant thermal and hydrological processes occurring above and beneath inland water surfaces to document past environmental and climate changes during the last 6000 cal yr BP. Special attention is paid to wind strength and direction, length and amplitude of the rainy season, and dry spell occurrence, all of which are of primary importance for plant distribution and pollen transport. In addition to climate changes and their impact on the natural environment, anthropogenic changes are also discussed. Two main features can be highlighted: (1) the shift from an earlier predominantly monsoonal climate regime to one dominated by northern Mediterranean ﬂuxes that occurred after 4000 cal yr BP. The direct consequence of this was the establishment of the modern desert environment at Yoa at 2700 cal yr BP. (2) Changes in climate parameters (simulated rainfall amount and dry spell length) between 6 and 4000 cal yr BP were comparatively minor. However, changes in the seasonal distribution of precipitation during this time interval dramatically affected the vegetation composition and were at the origin of the retreat of tropical plant communities from Lake Yoa.},

Together with local (fresh) ground-water input, this smaller Journal of Quatemarv Science temperature difference may explain the persistence of the Rhizophora mangrove and Guinean gallery forests near the shore until their massive extension during the early Holocene humid maximum around 9500 yr BP. Pollen data from the core are compared with data from Rosilda N1 10-Z, from the continental shelf at the same latitude.},

	abstract = {The coastal site of Ifri Oudadane is one of the most important sites in the Mediterranean Maghreb. Recent excavations have provided a stratigraphy featuring the transition from Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers to Neolithic food producers. This transitional process could be deﬁned by various features. The sedimentological ﬁeld description revealed a change from homogenous sediment to more structured deposits, and similar to the so-called “fumiers” that are characteristic of animal husbandry in caves and shelters around the Mediterranean. Sedimentary units identiﬁed in the deposits were conﬁrmed by geochemical and micromorphological studies. Within the Early Neolithic deposits coprolites and calcite spherulites testify to the penning of ovicaprides inside the shelter. Radiocarbon analyses date the change from Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic to approximately 7.6 ka calBP. Preliminary results from archaeozoological and archaeobotanical studies prove the existence of domesticated species in Neolithic deposits. Finally, together with pottery and notched blades, new artefact categories appear, reﬂecting changing settlement behaviour associated with Neolithic lifeways.},

Sedimentological and palynological data have been integrated with the aim of finding signals of natural processes within an urban context. Two main types of deposits alternate in the section: anthropogenic (AD) and waterlain (WD). The presence of laminated sediments within the WD deposits, suggesting short-term street flooding from heavy rainfall, encouraged the development of a targeted palynological sampling strategy. The results of the pollen analysis in these laminated sediments, e.g. high pollen concentrations (particularly of wet environment plants), clumped pollen grains, long distance pollen grains, and overall good state of preservation, suggest a stronger monsoonal influence than the present and high precipitation in S Oman between 204 bc and ad 130.},

Temporal variations in rainfall and temperatures of the Holocene Levant are reconstructed here from pollen data recovered from a sediment core drilled at the Ein Gedi shore, applying a novel biome model based on Bayesian statistics. Our results suggest that the region was arid and warm in the early Holocene period (w10e6.5 ka cal BP), wetter and colder in the mid Holocene (6.3e3.3 ka cal BP), and drier and warmer in the late Holocene (w3.2 ka cal BP to present). These periods comprise multi-centennial climate cycles that are characterized by rapid changes in temperature and precipitation reﬂecting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and atmospheric conditions over the Atlantic Ocean. The pollen record responds within a short time interval to the climate conditions and marks rapid shifts from Mediterranean to desert environmental conditions and back in the southern Levant region. We also evaluate our results in the light of possible disturbances of the natural vegetation, e.g. the possibility of forest decrease, since the Neolithic.},

Two main phases, separated by a brief regression, intervened between ca. 20,000 and 15,500 BP, and between 15,000 and 12,500 BP. Pollen analyses were carried out on four samples of this formation. The high lacustrine levels were associated to both important precipitations and a reduced evaporation linked to lower temperatures. Similar lacustrine deposits were found in the Djebel Marra in the south of the Sahara. In the mountains of the central and eastern Sahara, during the same period and until the middle Holocene, the AMiddle TerraceB Formation was deposited in the river valleys of the Tibesti, Hoggar, Air and the Red Sea Hills. Since the southern headwaters of the Nile were dry from ca. 20,000 to 12,500 BP, the fluviatile sediments deposited in the Nile valley in Nubia may have resulted almost entirely from the numerous wadis flowing from the Red Sea Hills.},

Finely-laminated lake sediments, dated at 8.5–6.7 cal kyr B.P., were examined in terms of lithology, geochemistry, microfossils (diatom, pollen) and magnetic susceptibility. Based on the inferred geographical derivation of pollen, the environmental aﬃliation of diatom taxa and geochemistry of lake sediments, wind trajectories were distinguished, related to two main atmospheric circulation phases. During the earlier phase (8.50–7.83 cal kyr B.P.) there were northwestern wind trajectories followed by southern ones and during the later phase (7.83–6.70 cal kyr B.P.), the northern winds were followed by northwestern and southern ones. Northwestern and northern winds brought winter rainfall and caused water turbulence in the lake, and the southern winds were associated with regional aridiﬁcation. This scenario of atmospheric circulation in northeastern Africa extends signiﬁcantly our understanding of key modes of climatic variability and wind trajectories in the Early to Middle Holocene (Greenlandian to Northgrippian) transition.},

New geoarchaeological research reveals that the early ports actually lie beneath the modern urban centres. During the Bronze Age, Tyre and Sidon were characterised by semi-open marine coves. After the ﬁrst millennium BC, our bio-sedimentological data attest to early artiﬁcial harbour infrastructure, before the later apogees of the Roman and Byzantine periods. Post-1000 AD, silting-up and coastal progradation led to burial of the ancient basins, lost until now, beneath the city centres. The outstanding preservation properties of such ﬁne-grained sedimentary contexts, coupled with the presence of the water table, means these two Levantine harbours are exceptionally preserved. This work has far-reaching implications for our understanding of Phoenician maritime archaeology and calls for the protection of these unique cultural heritages.},

Radiocarbon dates from four cores consistently cluster between ca. 500 B.C. and 1000 A.D. and indicate rapid rates of sedimentation in the basin, namely ¨10 mm/yr during the Greco-Roman and Byzantine periods, compared to 0.5 – 1 mm/yr for the period 6000 – 4000 B.C. Absence of strata between 4000 B.C. and 500 B.C. is not consistent with a natural base-level sediment sink and cannot be interpreted as a depositional hiatus in the high-stand systems tract. Ancient dredging is further corroborated by persistent age-depth inversions within the finegrained harbour facies. These data support removal of Middle Bronze Age to Persian period sediment strata, with deliberate overdeepening of the harbour bottom by Greco-Roman and Byzantine societies.},

This paper summarises palynological research carried out within a multidisciplinary archaeological research project on the Wadi Teshuinat area (Tadrart Acacus Mts., in south-western Fezzan, Libya). The sites were occupied by hunter-gatherer and pastoralist cultures. On-site pollen data, treated as a single ‘regional site’, showed that different pollen stratigraphies and ﬂora characterised the past phases. Plant macroremains also helped to understand local plant exploitation and landscape evolution. Pollen spectra showed the following climate oscillations: wet and cool (approx. 8800–8250 cal. BC), dry and warm (approx. 7920–7520 cal. BC), wet (approx. 7550–7200 cal. BC), dry (approx. 6340–6210 cal. BC—geoarchaeological evidence), wet and warm (approx. 6250–4300 cal. BC, including a wetter and warmer phase at approx. 5500–4600 cal. BC); dry and warm (approx. 4250–2900 cal. BC); drier and warm (approx. 2900–1600 cal. BC, up to the present). Since the early Holocene, both climatic and anthropic factors have played an important and strictly interconnected role in transforming the environment. Thus, while subsistence strategies were adjusting to climatic and environmental changes, the plant landscape was also being slowly and continuously shaped by humans.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Marmara region in northwestern Turkey provides a unique opportunity for studying the vegetation history in response to climate changes and anthropogenic impacts because of its location between different climate and vegetation zones and its long settlement history. Geochemical and mineralogical investigations of the largest lake in the region, Lake Iznik, already registered climate-related changes of the lake level and the lake mixing. However, a palynological investigation encompassing the Late Pleistocene to Middle Holocene was still missing. Here, we present the first pollen record of the last ca. 31 ka cal BP (calibrated kilo years before 1950) inferred from Lake Iznik sediments as an independent proxy for paleoecological reconstructions. Our study reveals that the vegetation in the Iznik area changed generally between (a) steppe during glacials and stadials indicating dry and cold climatic conditions, (b) forest-steppe during interstadials indicating milder and moister climatic conditions, and (c) oak-dominated mesic forest during interglacials indicating warm and moist climatic conditions. Moreover, a pronounced succession of pioneer trees, cold temperate, warm temperate, and Mediterranean trees appeared since the Lateglacial. Rapid climate changes, which are reflected by vegetation changes, can be correlated with Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events such as DO-4, DO-3, and DO-1, the Younger Dryas, and probably also the 8.2 event. Since the mid-Holocene, the vegetation was influenced by anthropogenic activities. During early settlement phases, the distinction between climate-induced and human-induced changes of the vegetation is challenging. Still, evidence for human activities consolidates since the Early Bronze Age (ca. 4.8 ka cal BP): cultivated trees, crops, and secondary human indicator taxa appeared, and forests were cleared. Subsequent fluctuations between extensive agricultural uses and regenerations of the natural vegetation become apparent.},

Results indicate the presence of domesticated plants, cereals (Hordeum vulgare, Triticum monococcum/dicoccum, Triticum durum and Triticum aestivum/durum) and pulses (Lens culinaris and Pisum sativum) in the Early Neolithic. One lentil has been dated to 7611 Æ 37 cal BP representing the oldest direct date of a domesticated plant seed in Morocco and, by extension, in North Africa. Similarities in both radiocarbon dates and crop assemblages from Early Neolithic sites in Northern Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula suggest a simultaneous East to West maritime spread of agriculture along the shores of the Western Mediterranean. Wild plants were abundantly collected in both the Epipalaeolithic and the Early Neolithic periods pointing to the important role of these resources during the two periods. In addition to fruits and seeds that could have been consumed by both humans and domesticated animals, fragments of esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima) rhizomes have been identiﬁed. This is a western Mediterranean native plant that may have been used as a source of ﬁbres for basketry.},

	abstract = {A new palaeoecological sequence from the western Iberian Central Range signiﬁcantly contributes to the knowledge on the Holocene vegetation dynamics in central Iberia. This sequence supports the existence of time-transgressive changes in the vegetation cover during the beginning of the Holocene over these central Iberian mountains, speciﬁcally the replacement of boreal birchepine forests with Mediterranean communities. Anthracological analyses also indicate the replacement of boreal pines (Pinus sylvestris) with Mediterranean ones (Pinus pinaster) during the early Holocene. The observed vegetation changes were generally synchronous with climatic phases previously reconstructed for the western Mediterranean region, and they suggest that the climatic trends were most similar to those recorded in the northern Mediterranean region and central Europe. Several cycles of secondary succession after ﬁre ending with the recovery of mature forest have been identiﬁed, which demonstrates that the vegetation of western Iberia was highly resilient to ﬁre disturbance. However, when the recurrence of ﬁre crossed a certain threshold, the original forests were not able to completely recover and shrublands and grasslands became dominant; this occurred approximately 5800e5400 cal yr BP. Afterwards, heathlands established as the dominant vegetation, which were maintained by frequent and severe wildﬁres most likely associated with human activities in a climatic framework that was less suitable for temperate trees. Finally, our palaeoecological record provides guidelines on how to manage protected areas in Mediterranean mountains of southwestern Europe, especially regarding the conservation and restoration of temperate communities that are threatened there such as birch stands.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the vegetation history of Sardinia, the second largest island of the Mediterranean, is scanty. Here, we present a new sedimentary record covering the past {\textasciitilde} 8,000 years from Lago di Baratz, north-west Sardinia. Vegetation and fire history are reconstructed by pollen, spores, macrofossils and charcoal analyses and environmental dynamics by highresolution element geochemistry together with pigment analyses. During the period 8,100–7,500 cal bp, when seasonality was high and fire and erosion were frequent, Erica arborea and E. scoparia woodlands dominated the coastal landscape. Subsequently, between 7,500 and 5,500 cal bp, seasonality gradually declined and thermo-mediterranean woodlands with Pistacia and Quercus ilex partially replaced Erica communities under diminished incidence of fire. After 5,500 cal bp, evergreen oak forests expanded markedly, erosion declined and lake levels increased, likely in response to increasing (summer) moisture availability. Increased anthropogenic fire disturbance triggered shrubland expansions (e.g. Tamarix and Pistacia) around 5,000–4,500 cal bp. Subsequently around 4,000–3,500 cal bp evergreen oak-olive forests expanded massively when fire activity declined and lake productivity and anoxia reached Holocene maxima. Land-use activities during the past 4,000 years (since the Bronze Age) gradually disrupted coastal forests, but relict stands persisted under rather stable environmental conditions until ca. 200 cal bp, when agricultural activities intensified and Pinus and Eucalyptus were planted to stabilize the sand dunes. Pervasive prehistoric land-use activities since at least the Bronze Age Nuraghi period included the cultivation of Prunus, Olea europaea and Juglans regia after 3,500–3,300 cal bp, and Quercus suber after 2,500 cal bp. We conclude that restoring less flammable native Q. ilex and O. europaea forest communities would markedly reduce fire risk and erodibility compared to recent forest plantations with flammable non-native trees (e.g. Pinus, Eucalyptus) and xerophytic shrubland (e.g. Cistus, Erica).},

	abstract = {Although lake levels fluctuations are known from Ethiopia during the late Holocene, few continuous paleoclimatic records are available from the high plateau. A 3000 yr high resolution pollen record from the Arsi Mountain in Arussi province of southeastern Ethiopia, provides information on recent changes in the vegetation, above the upper tree line, at 3600 m elevation. The organic sediment was deposited into the Dega Sala swamp ca. 3000 yr B.P., on top of a coarse gravel representing a solifuxion deposit linked to neoglacial advance. The surrounding vegetation was established as that of the Ericaceous belt, with Ericaceae shrub dominant. The pollen diagram registers significant changes in the relative frequencies of the local herbaceous pollen component versus the arboreal taxa from the upper forest limit. Allowing the high altitude of the site, such changes indicate downward movements of the vegetation belts that are due mainly to temperature variations. An estimated cooling of 2°C is registered at 560\_\_\_120 yr B.P. (AMS date), contemporaneous with the Little Ice Age. The successive upward regrowth of the forest is rather indicative of a recent warming than linked to recolonization of the forest following anthropogenic deforestation, unlikely at altitude above potential cultivation.},

The upper sediments (6-4.5 ka), grading from laminated carbonates to coarsely bedded and massive layers with aeolian sands, have reduced frequencies of Sudanian pollen taxa, and increases in Saharan types and sedge-dominated local pollen spectra. A possible vegetational reconstruction is a mosaic of savanna woodlands associated with groundwater-supported lakes and marshes between 9 and 6 ka BP, and sparser cover of steppe and semidesert communities between 6 and 4.5 ka BP as water tables dropped and hyperarid conditions were restored.},

            Pollen studies of marine sediments from Atlantic deep-sea core V22-196 (13°50′ N-18°57′ W; 3728-m water depth) are used to reconstruct paleoclimates of north tropical west Africa since 140,000 yr B.P. High concentration of pollen, mainly from Saharan and arid littoral zones suggests a strengthened tradewind circulation since ca. 60,000 yr B.P. that became even stronger after 40,000 yr B.P. and reached a maximum 17,000 yr B.P. Periods of eolian transport of pollen to the Atlantic occurred about 94,000 and 105,000 yr B.P. and during Termination II. Conversely, high relative values of pollen from Sudanian and Guinean zones and from Mangrove and freshwater vegetation, coincident with maxima of dinocyst concentration, are interpreted as reflecting both strong fluvial inputs and the expansion of humid vegetation on the adjacent continent during wet periods dated between 140,000 and 118,000, 105,000 and 96,000, 92,000 and 73,000, 52,000 and 44,000 yr B.P. and 12,000 yr B.P. and the Holocene. The strong correlation of these results from the eastern tropical Atlantic with those from the Arabian Sea corroborates fluctuations of monsoon climate.},

	abstract = {Four Holocene pollen diagrams are presented from interdune depressions in the Manga Grasslands (northeastern Nigeria near 13°N). These sequences are interpreted using modern pollen spectra, statistical analyses and groupings based on phytogeographical affinity (Long Distance, Sahelian, Sudanian, Guinean). The roles of climate change and anthropogenic activity in the vegetational history of the central part of Sahel are evaluated. Particular attention is given to the separation of regional (Manga Grasslands) from local (individual depressions) vegetation trends. Humid conditions in the early and mid-Holocene (from 10,000 to ca. 3300 yr B.P.) enabled the establishment of, and sustained, swamp forest vegetation in the interdune depressions. The main taxa (Alchornea, Syzygium and Uapaca) have Guinean affinities. The surrounding dunefields consisted of open savanna with Sahelian and Sudanian (e.g., Combretaceae, Detarium) elements present. Drier conditions ca. 3300 yr B.P. produced abrupt changes in pollen stratigraphy and led to the establishment of the modern vegetation of the Manga Grasslands. Although occupied since at least 3700 yr B.P., there is little evidence of human activity in the pollen diagrams. The nomadic pastoralism practiced by the human occupants of the Manga Grasslands may be palynologically undetectable. Although the Holocene vegetational history of the Manga Grasslands appears to have been primarily controlled by climate, caution should be exercised before drawing climatic inferences from these pollen sequences. For the early and mid-Holocene differences of ca. 1000 years exist in the timing of vegetation changes between the individual depressions. While water levels in the depressions are likely to be coupled to climate, the vegetation response appears to be strongly influenced by local conditions (in particular variations in the depth of depressions and so the relative height of water table). In addition, the Guinean swamp forest vegetation of the early and mid-Holocene is unlikely to be representative of vegetation trends at this latitude, but rather developed extrazonally as a result of the particular topographic/hydrological conditions prevailing in the Manga Grasslands. The problems of lags between climate and vegetation change and the presence of extrazonal vegetation, experienced in the Manga Grasslands, are likely to be common to other Sahelian pollen sites. The palynological information presently available for this zone is deemed insufficient for detailed subcontinental scale reconstructions of vegetation and climate to be attempted. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The main taxa (Alchornea, Syzygium and Uapaca) have Guinean affinities. The surrounding dunefields consisted of open savanna with Sahelian and Sudanian (e.g., Combretaceae, Detarium) elements present. Drier conditions ca. 3300 yr B.P. produced abrupt changes in pollen stratigraphy and led to the establishment of the modern vegetation of the Manga Grasslands. Although occupied since at least 3700 yr B.P., there is little evidence of human activity in the pollen diagrams. The nomadic pastoralism practiced by the human occupants of the Manga Grasslands may be palynologically undetectable. Although the Holocene vegetational history of the Manga Grasslands appears to have been primarily controlled by climate, caution should be exercised before drawing climatic inferences from these pollen sequences. For the early and mid-Holocene differences of ca. 1000 years exist in the timing of vegetation changes between the individual depressions. While water levels in the depressions are likely to be coupled to climate, the vegetation response appears to be strongly influenced by local conditions (in particular variations in the depth of depressions and so the relative height of water table). In addition, the Guinean swamp forest vegetation of the early and mid-Holocene is unlikely to be representative of vegetation trends at this latitude, but rather developed extrazonally as a result of the particular topographic/hydrological conditions prevailing in the Manga Grasslands. The problems of lags between climate and vegetation change and the presence of extrazonal vegetation, experienced in the Manga Grasslands, are likely to be common to other Sahelian pollen sites. The palynological information presently available for this zone is deemed insufficient for detailed subcontinental scale reconstructions of vegetation and climate to be attempted. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

              The Lake Tilla crater lake in northeastern Nigeria (10°23′N, 12°08′E) provides a ca. 17,000
              14
              C yr multiproxy record of the environmental history of a Sudanian savanna in West Africa. Evaluation of pollen, diatoms, and sedimentary geochemistry from cores suggests that dry climatic conditions prevailed throughout the late Pleistocene. Before the onset of the Holocene, the slow rise in lake levels was interrupted by a distinct dry event between ca. 10,900 and 10,500
              14
              C yr B.P., which may coincide with the Younger Dryas episode. The onset of the Holocene is marked by an abrupt increase in lake levels and a subsequent spread of Guinean and Sudanian tree taxa into the open grass savanna that predominated throughout the Late Pleistocene. The dominance of the mountain olive
              Olea hochstetteri
              suggests cool climatic conditions prior to ca. 8600
              14
              C yr B.P. The early to mid-Holocene humid period culminated between ca. 8500 and 7000
              14
              C yr B.P. with the establishment of a dense Guinean savanna during high lake levels. Frequent fires were important in promoting the open character of the vegetation. The palynological and palaeolimnological data demonstrate that the humid period terminated after ca. 7000
              14
              C yr B.P. in a gradual decline of the precipitation/evaporation ratio and was not interrupted by abrupt climatic events. The aridification trend intensified after ca. 3800

                  Worldwide, large wildfires are becoming increasingly common, leading to economic damages and threatening ecosystems and human health. Under future climate change, more frequent fire disturbance may push ecosystems into non‐forested alternative stable states. Fire‐prone ecosystems such as those in the Mediterranean Basin are expected to be particularly vulnerable, but the position of tipping points is unclear.
                
                
                  We compare long‐term palaeoecological data from Sardinia with output from a process‐based dynamic vegetation model to investigate the mechanisms controlling the complex interactions between fire, climate, and vegetation in the past and the future.
                
                
                  
                    Our results show that past vegetation changes from
                    Erica
                    ‐shrublands to mixed evergreen‐broadleaved
                    Quercus ilex
                    ‐dominated forests were driven by a climate‐induced fire regime shift. By simulating vegetation dynamics under varying fire regimes, we could reproduce Holocene vegetation trajectories and mechanistically identify tipping points.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Without an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, we simulate future expansion of fire‐prone Mediterranean maquis and increasing fire occurrence. Similarly, high anthropogenic ignition frequencies and plantations of non‐native, highly flammable trees could induce a shift to fire‐adapted
                    Erica
                    shrublands. However, our simulations indicate that if global warming can be kept below 2°C,
                    Quercus ilex
                    forests will be able to persist and effectively reduce fire occurrences and impacts, making them a valuable restoration target in Mediterranean ecosystems.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis
                    . By combining long‐term records of ecosystem change with a dynamic vegetation model, we show that past climate‐driven fire regime shifts were the main driver of vegetation change, creating alternative stable states that persisted over centuries. Projected future climate change exceeding Holocene variability leads to pronounced vegetation changes and increased fire risks in our simulations, requiring new fire management strategies to maintain current ecosystem services.},

Called Gobero, this suite of closely spaced sites chronicles the rapid pace of biosocial change in the southern Sahara in response to severe climatic fluctuation.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Two main occupational phases are identified that correspond with humid intervals in the early and mid-Holocene, based on 78 direct AMS radiocarbon dates on human remains, fauna and artifacts, as well as 9 OSL dates on paleodune sand. The older occupants have craniofacial dimensions that demonstrate similarities with midHolocene occupants of the southern Sahara and Late Pleistocene to early Holocene inhabitants of the Maghreb. Their hyperflexed burials compose the earliest cemetery in the Sahara dating to ,7500 B.C.E. These early occupants abandon the area under arid conditions and, when humid conditions return ,4600 B.C.E., are replaced by a more gracile people with elaborated grave goods including animal bone and ivory ornaments.
Conclusions/Significance: The principal significance of Gobero lies in its extraordinary human, faunal, and archaeological record, from which we conclude the following:},

The overall similarity of heavymineral suites in the different late Quaternary sand layers of the northeastern Delta is primarily a function of mineralogical homogenization resulting from transport processes: (a) masking of White Nile sediments by dominant Blue Nile and Atbara components recycled together north of Khartoum; and (b) reworking of sediments back-and-forth between different fluvio-marine environments in the northern Delta. Study of specific heavy minerals such as the amphiboles which are derived from both central Africa and Ethiopian Plateau serves to more precisely interpret provenance and also to identify and map some distinct lithostratigraphic units.

In addition to the present-day elements growing in North Africa the flora was supposed to have included some European arboreal species. This concept was mainly based on the results of pollen analysis. More recent pollen and macrofossil analysis of organic sediments from the Ahaggar massif show that mid-Holocene flora was actually very similar to that found at the present day. Earlier studies had included analysis of sediment contaminated by pollen transported long distances which had accumulated over a period of 4000 years. An endemic olive (Olea laperrini) and the Atlas pistachio tree (Pistacia atlantica), two species which are still well represented nowadays, dominated the vegetation. The new data question the extension of the Mediterranean vegetation towards the south and the amplitude of the associated climatic change.},

	abstract = {We used a new sedimentary record to reconstruct the Holocene vegetation and ﬁre history of Gorgo Basso, a coastal lake in south-western Sicily (Italy). Pollen and charcoal data suggest a ﬁre-prone open grassland near the site until ca 10,000 cal yr BP (8050 cal BC), when Pistacia shrubland expanded and ﬁre activity declined, probably in response to increased moisture availability. Evergreen Olea europaea woods expanded ca 8400 to decline abruptly at 8200 cal yr BP, when climatic conditions became drier at other sites in the Mediterranean region. Around 7000 cal yr BP evergreen broadleaved forests (Quercus ilex, Quercus suber and O. europaea) expanded at the cost of open communities. The expansion of evergreen broadleaved forests was associated with a decline of ﬁre and of local Neolithic (Ficus carica–Cerealia based) agriculture that had initiated ca 500 years earlier. Vegetational, ﬁre and land-use changes ca 7000 cal yr BP were probably caused by increased precipitation that resulted from (insolation-forced) weakening of the monsoon and Hadley circulation ca 8000–6000 cal yr BP. Low ﬁre activity and dense coastal evergreen forests persisted until renewed human activity (probably Greek, respectively Roman colonists) disrupted the forest ca 2700 cal yr BP (750 BC) and 2100 cal yr BP (150 BC) to gain open land for agriculture. The intense use of ﬁre for this purpose induced the expansion of open maquis, garrigue, and grassland-prairie environments (with an increasing abundance of the native palm Chamaerops humilis). Prehistoric land-use phases after the Bronze Age seem synchronous with those at other sites in southern and central Europe, possibly as a result of climatic forcing. Considering the response of vegetation to Holocene climatic variability as well as human impact we conclude that under (semi-)natural conditions evergreen broadleaved Q. ilex–O. europaea (s.l.) forests would still dominate near Gorgo Basso. However, forecasted climate change and aridiﬁcation may lead to a situation similar to that before 7000 cal yr BP and thus trigger a rapid collapse of the few relict evergreen broadleaved woodlands in coastal Sicily and elsewhere in the southern Mediterranean region.},

	abstract = {Methods: We extracted fossil pollen and macro‐charcoal from a sediment sequence collected in present‐day monodominant Gilbertiodendron forest stand that spans the last 2,700 years. Climatic changes were inferred using other published palaeoecological records from Central Africa. We also looked at Gilbertiodendron dewevrei's present‐day ecological tolerances.
Results: Gilbertiodendron pollen was found in every sample covering the last 2,700 years in similar percentages to present‐day soil surface samples. In addition, no statistically significant change in pollen composition was found during this time despite vegetation changes being documented in nearby mixed and swamp forest cores over the same time period. No evidence of fire was found for a period of 2,400 years. Only minimal burning occurred over the last 300 years in this monodominant stand. The analysis of ecological tolerances shows G. dewevrei has a broad niche for precipitation (1,300–2,460 mm).
Conclusions: Our pollen record is the first to describe the long‐term ecological history of an African monodominant forest. Our results show this monodominant stand existed over the past 2,700 years mostly in the absence of fire, providing support for the low disturbance hypothesis as an explanation for monodominance persistence. However, we show that the monodominant forest was continuous, at this site, despite climatic fluctuations in the immediate region. This combined with the broad tolerance of water requirements of the species suggests a potential resilience to future climate variability. However, additional pollen records from a wider area are needed to confirm this.},

Consequently, little is known about time-dependent relationships between vegetation, environment and the development of human settlements in this area. To help ﬁll this gap for the arid Hajar mountains of northern Oman, a 20 m deep proﬁle in a sediment-ﬁlled depression near an oasis settlement was analysed for its physico-chemical properties, pollen and spores and other palynomorphs. Charcoal frequencies in combination with geochemical data provided evidence of an Early Holocene increase of rainfall. The onset of dryer conditions at about 8 ka was indicated by charcoal frequencies and geochemical data as were previously unrecognised short humid periods dated to 5.7, 5 and 4.4 ka. The upper 4 m of sediments contained a 4300 year-old pollen proﬁle reaching into the archaeologically important Umm al-Nar period characterized by increased settlement activities throughout Oman. Variation in mollusc shell frequency and periodic peaks of NH4-N suggested only minor local variations of rainfall throughout the last 2000 years. The sudden appearance of Olea spec., Ziziphus and Fabaceae pollen since about 500 years ago points to a late onset of oasis agriculture nearby.},

Macroanalysis, mainly of seeds, was carried out on twelve samples. Twenty-four levels were radiocarbon-dated. The dominant factors determining the vegetation succession appear to be climatic change in the earlier phases, gradually overshadowed by human activity in later phases, resulting in accelerated landscape degradation and soil erosion. Five main periods of vegetation succession are distinguished: A (c. 10,350 8700 BP, 5 zones): Late-Glacial steppe succeeds to xerothermic forests under warm and rather dry climatic conditions and without human interference. B (c. 8700 5670 BP. 6 zones): Climate turning moister and cooler is the main factor determining the forest dynamics. Eight climatic cycles consisting of a wet and a dry phase each were inferred. The forest changes from xerothermic to mesothermic c. 8240 BP. The anthropogenic factor starts to play a minor but increasing role.},

	abstract = {This study provides a high-resolution reconstruction of the vegetation of the Argive Plain (Peloponnese, Greece) covering 5000 years from the Early Bronze Age onwards. The well dated pollen record from ancient Lake Lerna has been interpreted in the light of archaeological and historical sources, climatic data from the same core and other regional proxies. Our results demonstrate a significant degree of human impact on the environments of the Argive Plain throughout the study period. During the Early Bronze Age evidence of a thermophilous vegetation is seen in the pollen record, representing the mixed deciduous oak woodland of the Peloponnesian uplands. The plain was mainly used for the cultivation of cereals, whereas local fen conditions prevailed at the coring site. Towards the end of this period an increasing water table is recorded and the fen turns into a lake, despite more arid conditions. In the Late Bronze Age, the presence of important palatial centres modified the landscape resulting in decrease of mixed deciduous oak woodland and increase in open land, partly used for grazing. Possibly, the human management produced a permanent hydrological change at Lake Lerna. From the Archaic period onwards the increasing human pressure in association with local drier conditions caused landscape instability, as attested by a dramatic alluvial event recorded in the
              Pinus
              curve at the end of the Hellenistic Age. Wet conditions coincided with Roman times and favoured a forest regeneration pattern in the area, at the same time as we see the most intensive olive cultivation in the pollen record. The establishment of an economic landscape primarily based on pastures is recorded in the Byzantine period and continues until modern times. Overgrazing and fires in combination with arid conditions likely caused degradation of the vegetation into garrigue, as seen in the area of the Argive Plain today.},

	abstract = {A pollen diagram from Lake Monticchio, a volcanic crater lake in S Central Italy east of Naples, shows a long vegetation record for the Holocene and the later portion of the Last (Weichselian) Glacial Period. The upper 735 cm of a 2550-cm core is assigned to the Holocene. It begins with expansion of
              Betula
              (birch) and
              Quercus
              (oak), followed by
              Fagus
              (beech),
              Tilia
              (lime) and other mesic trees. In the next phase the flora is dominated by oak with an increase in herb pollen. In the later Holocene the flora is again diversified by the appearance of
              Abies
              (fir),
              Curpinus
              (hornbeam) and other trees. In the latest Pleistocene portion of the core the vegetation is dominated by grasses,
              Artemisia
              (sage-brush) and chenopods, indicating a treeless environment. The base of the core shows continued dominance by steppe-like vegetation with 'interstadial' episodes in which trees, especially oak, beech and fir, were abundant. The climatic interpretation is that the late Pleistocene was very dry, at least in the summer growing season, and probably, although not necessarily, colder than now. In the Holocene increased precipitation favoured expansion of tree populations. For a brief period there was a return of water stress in the growing season marked by a loss of tree species diversity and an increase in herbs. In the later Holocene a progressive diversification of tree species indicates a return to a more humid and perhaps cooler climate. The vegetation history and climatic inferences are closely similar to records available from Greece. The available radiocarbon dates, which show a consistent pattern, indicate that the core is much older than 40000 years at the base but not old enough to include the major post-Eemian interstadials. The 'Holocene' birch expansion began nearly 20000 years ago. These dates appear to be systematically too old in the light of present knowledge. The preliminary character of the study is emphasized. Further radiocarbon dates, especially of the 'Holocene' section, are needed, as are more detailed studies of sedimentation processes and tephra occurrences.},

	abstract = {Rezina marsh, a small basin at a height of 1800 m, in the Pindus mountain range, is both the smallest and highest site yet to be studied in Greece. Techniques of pollen and plant macrofossil analysis, sediment chemistry, mineral magnetics and radiocarbon dating have been employed to reconstruct both vegetational and sedimentary history of the basin. The sequence extending back to c. 10000 BP, provides the first evidence for the possible location of full glacial refugia for temperate tree taxa in Greece. In the early postglacial a dense mixed woodland containing at least sixteen different tree taxa was present around the Rezina basin. This woodland persisted throughout the early postglacial although dominance of tree types in the woodlands changed several times. These changes are thought to be closely related to climatic changes during the early postglacial. At c. 6000 BP both the density and diversity of the woodland became greatly reduced. Although there was some recovery of the woodland at c. 5000 BP, anthropogenic intervention at c. 4000 BP led to total destruction of this montane forest and the development of open grassland similar to the present day situation.},

	abstract = {The littoral site of Ifri Oudadane is one of the most important recently excavated sites in the Mediterranean Maghreb. The shelter presents Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic layers and therefore offers the possibility to investigate the Neolithic transition in the region. Besides introducing the archaeological context, this paper focuses on palaeobotanical data in order to reconstruct Holocene environmental change and human use of plant resources for the period c. 11 to 5.7 ka cal. BP. Results show intense landscape transformations resulting from anthropic and climatic factors. First human occupations start at the beginning of the Holocene with favourable conditions in this otherwise harsh semi-arid stretch of land. A wooded environment with evergreen sclerophyllous oaks and riparian forests is documented and exploited by hunter-gatherers. From c. 7.6 ka cal. BP farming activities are well attested together with significant human impact, herding pressure and a progressive decline of arboreal components. After 6.6 ka cal. BP conditions become less favourable and markers for aridity increase. Riparian taxa disappear (Alnus) or decrease (Fraxinus, Populus, Salix); shrubs (Tamarix) and grasses (Artemisia) increase with a degradation of forest into shrubland (macchia). During 6.6 and 6.0 ka cal. BP there is a general occupation gap in arid and semi-arid Morocco and evidence for that change is also found in the alluvial deposits of the Moulouya, NE Morocco. Indicators for food production decrease at the same time and the site is abandoned during the first half of the 6th millennium cal. BP.},

	abstract = {The limited availability of high-resolution continuous archives, insufﬁcient chronological control, and complex hydro-climatic forcing mechanisms lead to many uncertainties in palaeo-hydrological reconstructions for the Western Mediterranean. In this study we present a newly recovered 19.63 m long core from Lake Sidi Ali in the North African Middle Atlas, a transition zone of Atlantic, Western Mediterranean and Saharan air mass trajectories. With a multi-proxy approach based on magnetic susceptibility, carbonate and total organic C content, core-scanning and quantitative XRF, stable isotopes of ostracod shells, charcoal counts, Cedrus pollen abundance, and a ﬁrst set of diatom data, we reconstruct Western Mediterranean hydro-climatic variability, seasonality and forcing mechanisms during the last 12,000 yr. A robust chronological model based on AMS 14C dated pollen concentrates supports our highresolution multi-proxy study. Long-term trends reveal low lake levels at the end of the Younger Dryas, during the mid-Holocene interval 6.6 to 5.4 cal ka BP, and during the last 3000 years. In contrast, lake levels are mostly high during the Early and Mid-Holocene. The record also shows sub-millennial- to centennial-scale decreases in Western Mediterranean winter rain at 11.4, 10.3, 9.2, 8.2, 7.2, 6.6, 6.0, 5.4, 5.0, 4.4, 3.5, 2.9, 2.2, 1.9, 1.7, 1.5, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.2 cal ka BP. Early Holocene winter rain minima are in phase with cooling events and millennial-scale meltwater discharges in the sub-polar North Atlantic. Our proxy parameters do not show so far a clear impact of Saharan air masses on Mediterranean hydro-climate in North Africa. However, a signiﬁcant hydro-climatic shift at the end of the African Humid Period ({\textasciitilde}5 ka) indicates a change in climate forcing mechanisms. The Late Holocene climate variability in the Middle Atlas features a multi-centennial-scale NAO-type pattern, with Atlantic cooling and Western Mediterranean winter rain maxima generally associated with solar minima.},
