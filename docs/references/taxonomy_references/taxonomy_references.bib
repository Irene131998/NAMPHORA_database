	abstract = {The Dimorphandra group, as traditionally circumscribed, is a rather diverse assemblage of genera in Leguminosae subfamily Caesalpinioideae that share certain morphological characteristics with the basally branching lineages of subfamily Mimosoideae. It currently comprises 51 species in seven genera: Burkea (1 species), Dimorphandra (26 species), Erythrophleum (10 species), Mora (6 species), Pachyelasma (1 species), Stachyothyrsus (2 species) and Sympetalandra (5 species). This study investigates the pollen morphology of 25 samples from 19 species of all seven genera. Pollen of the Dimorphandra group is small, isopolar, trizonocolporate and released in monads. Apertures are almost equal to polar length, with correspondingly small apocolpial areas. The shape of the aperture apices varies from acute to wide and rounded. Surface ornamentation is psilate, perforate, microreticulate, or perforate-rugulate. The wall structure is usually columellate with a well developed foot layer. The pollen is small and unspecialised, agreeing with a previously noted pattern of more fixed and homogenous pollen structure in the more derived clades in subfamily Caesalpinioideae, compared with the great diversity of pollen types found in the basally branching lineages.},

	abstract = {Pollen grains of 250 samples of taxa in the Cercideae clade have been studied using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. This study examines how pollen morphological structures can be used as taxonomic characters in systematic studies. Pollen grains of the ﬁrst branching taxa in the Cercideae phylogeny, such as Cercis and Adenolobus, are unspecialised; they are isopolar, tectate, tricolporate, and released in monads. Surface ornamentation may be micro-reticulate or perforate, and psilate to rugulate. Aperture membranes are granular to coarsely granular. More specialised pollen grain structures are found in Schnella, Lasiobema, Phanera, Piliostigma and most of Bauhinia s.s. Pollen morphology is presented in a table for comparative purposes and illustrated, discussed and compared. Six specialised pollen structures described and identiﬁed are diagnostic for groups of related species in the Cercideae. These include a granular infratectum, syncolporate apertures, pororate apertures, spiny opercula, tetrads, and non-supratectal spines. Porate apertures occur in Phanera, Piliostigma and Bauhinia picta. Five pollen structures have been identiﬁed within the Cercideae clade that is restricted to Bauhinia s.s. These include striate ornamentation, having more than three apertures per grain, apertures that are indistinct, and colpate apertures. Supratectal ornamentation, structures such as gemmae, verrucae and striae, occur in many species in the Cercideae, as well as throughout subfamily Caesalpinioideae, and the functional implications of this are discussed. Pollen morphological structures are discussed with regard to systematic signiﬁcance, taxonomic utility, and in relation to functional and developmental considerations.},

	abstract = {Xyridaceae are a predominantly tropical family of five genera that exhibit two pollen morphologies often considered to be of taxonomie importance. Xyris comprises about 95\% of the species and is characterized by medium to large, elliptic, sulcate pollen grains. The other pollen class is spheroidal grains without an evident aperture. Many of the species with spheroidal grains have remarkably large and ornamented pollen found to be species specific in earlier research. A scanning electron microscopy investigation of 23 taxa representing all genera with spheroidal pollen revealed new data to further distinguish the genera based on pollen characters. Reliable specific pollen characters need to be evaluated in a statistical study.},

	abstract = {Pollen morphology of 15 taxa belonging to the section Hololeuce Bunge of genus Astragalus L. species was investigated by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Pollen slides were prepared using a Wodehouse technique. Measurements were based on 20 or more pollen grains per specimen. For scanning electron microscopy studies, dried pollen grains were transferred on aluminium stubs and coated with gold for 4 min in a sputter-coater. The pollen grains of Hololeuce taxa are radially symmetric and isopolar. The pollen grains of the taxa are prolate–spheroidal, subprolate or prolate with the polar axes 21.42–32.93 μm and the equatorial axes 17.13–28.26 μm. The pollen grains are operculate and trizonocolporate. Syncolporate. Colpi were usually long and narrow (Clt: 4.13–6.68 μm, Clg: 16.56–26.52 μm), subterminal, membrane granulate or verrucate. Pores were found to be longate or circular (Plg: 5.01–7.82 μm, Plt: 5.31–8.69 μm). Operculum membrane ornamentation verrucate, granulate, rugulate and reticulate. Pollen grains show reticulate, perforate polar section and perforate, reticulate, microreticulate, perforate–granulate, microreticulate–perforate, microrugulate–perforate, microrugulate–microreticulate, granulate–perforate, microreticulate–granulate at meridional sections. Exine is subtectate and has a thickness of 1.08–1.30 μm. Ectexine is thicker than endexine. Intine has a thickness of 0.5–0.68 μm. As result of this study some pollen characteristic as pollen shape, aperture type and ornamentations are shown to vary within the section Hololeuce. Especially pollen surface ornamentation on polar section and meridional section has systematic value to distinguish taxa from each other.},

	abstract = {Fossil plants are extinct plants whose remains (referred to as plant fossils) are found preserved in sedimentary deposits. Plant fossils are classified using fossil-taxa as defined in the International Code of Nomenclature. Fossil-taxa differ conceptually from taxa of living plants in that they often do not refer to whole organisms, but to the remains of one or more parts of the parent organism, in one or more preservational states. There can be complications when two parts of a plant are shown to be connected, or when two preservational states are correlated, and to avoid disrupting the wider palaeobotanical taxonomy it is often best to keep the fossil-taxa separate. Extinct fossil plants reconstructed by piecing together the plant fossils are best not given formal Linnean taxonomic names. There can also be problems using living plant taxa for fossils, even when there is a close morphological similarity of particular plant parts. Fossil-taxa for different plant parts can reflect different taxonomic ranks of the parent plants so care must be taken when using such taxa in floristic or phylogenetic studies. Because of taphonomic factors, a number of “artificial” fossil-taxa have proved useful, despite that they do not fully reflect the systematic positions of the parent plants.},

	abstract = {Myrsine, a genus in the family Primulaceae, includes closely related species whose taxonomic identification is difficult. Morphological analysis of pollen grains has provided key information for the classification of Primulaceae, helping clarify the taxonomy of several genera, subgenera, and species. However, a detailed study of pollen morphology in Myrsine was still lacking. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the potential of pollen characters to be used for the specific delimitation of Myrsine. Acetolyzed pollen grains were examined using light microscopy and non-acetolyzed pollen grains were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Pollen grains and monads of all analyzed species were isopolar, small to medium in size, and prolate spheroidal, subprolate, or prolate in shape, with (3)-4-colporate apertures, regular colpi or loxocolpi, and reticulate-granulate, granulate, rugulate-granulate, or microreticulate exine. Species considered difficult to identify based on other morphological traits were successfully distinguished using quantitative and qualitative pollen characters, confirming the importance of pollen morphology as a source of taxonomic information. Also, Myrsine stands out among genera of the subfamily Myrsinoideae because it shows great interspecific pollen variation, including two class sizes of pollen grains, three types of exine ornamentation, and exclusive loxocolporate pollen with inconspicuous endoapertures. This is the first report of loxocolporate pollen in Primulaceae.},

	abstract = {Complementary to the revision of the genus Spermacoce in the Northern Territory of Australia, pollen morphology of 48 of the 53 native Spermacoce species from the Northern Territory has been investigated by scanning electron and light microscopy. There is considerable variation for most diagnostic pollen characters. The average equatorial diameter (E) ranges from 10.5 to 41.7 µm. Grains are invariably colporate with the apertures situated at the equator (being zonocolporate). The number of apertures varies from 3 to 17. The endoaperture is generally an endocingulum, often with a secondary thinning at the ectocolpus; one species has endocolpi. The sexine is usually perforate, but psilate, foveolate, and (micro)reticulate patterns were also found. Supratectal elements are present as granules or microspines scattered over the whole surface or conﬁned to a region around the ectoapertures. The inner nexine surface is granular, often with irregular grooves (endocracks).},

	title = {Pollen {Morphology} of the {Dilleniaceae} and {Actinidiaceae}},
	abstract = {Pollen of 53 species of Dilleniaceae and Actinidiaceae was examined by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and a selected group in transmission electron microscopy. Dilleniaceae pollen ranges from tricolpate, tricolporate, tetracolpate, and incipiently inaperturate. Tricolpate types occur only among the Old World subfamily Dillenioideae and the compound aperturate (3-colporate) condition is restricted to the subfamily Tetraceroideae. Within the Dilleniaceae the tricolpate pollen type with elongated apertures is considered primitive, having given rise to the 3-colporate and 4-colpate conditions. The striking pollen dimorphism in the Neotropical species of Tetracera, all of which are androdioecious, is documented; however, in contrast toprevious reports, pollen from bisexual flowers appears to be incipiently inaperturate and not pantoporate. The inaperturate condition is interpretated as an early stage in the evolution of outcrossing. Pollen morphology does not support a close relationship between Dilleniaceae and Actinidiaceae. Pollen morphological differences that can be noted between these families are: tectum complete and predominantly psilate or psilate-granular in Actinidiaceae, tectum incomplete, punctate to reticulate in Dilleniaceae; an equatorial bridge of ektexine over the endoaperture usually present in Actinidiaceae, absent in Dilleniaceae; columellae reduced in Actinidiaceae, columellae usually well-developed in Dilleniaceae. Pollen morphology does not argue against a close relationship between Actinidiaceae and Theaceae.},

	abstract = {The pollen morphology of 23 Brazilian native species of Rubiaceae Juss. from forest fragments of a Cerrado area was analyzed using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in the search for new characters that might increase the knowledge on the pollen morphology of the species, and also aiming to help in the taxonomic characterization of the genera. For LM, the pollen grains were acetolyzed, measured, photographed and described qualitatively, whereas for SEM, the non-acetolyzed pollen grains were observed for further details of ornamentation. The analyzed species were grouped into three pollen types based on pollen unit and polarity, and three subtypes were separated considering the type of apertures; the surface ornamentation details were evidenced within each pollen type. The pollen grains are tetrad (Randia, microreticulate) or monad, apolar and inaperturate (Psychotria, reticulate-retipilate) or 2-porate (Coussarea, microreticulate), isopolar and porate (3-porate – Chomelia, reticulate-retipilate; Faramea, microreticulate-striate; Guettarda, reticulate-retipilate or rugulate; 3–4-porate – Tocoyena, foveolate; 6-porate – Mitracarpus, microreticulate-baculate), colpate (3-colpate – Psychotria, reticulate-retipilate; 7-colpate – Borreria, microreticulate-baculate), colporate (3-colporate –Chiococca and Ixora, microreticulate, Genipa and Simira, reticulate; Coutarea, microreticulate-echinate; Rudgea, microreticulate-baculate; 4-colporate – Manettia, reticulate). The metric data of the pollen grains examined by descriptive and multivariate analysis (Principal component analysis and Cluster analysis) allow the distinction of groups of species based on the size and shape. The results indicate the importance of qualitative and quantitative data and reinforce a wide morphological pollen diversity of Rubiaceae species from forest fragments in Cerrado which conﬁrms the family as eurypalynous.},

Pollen grains from fresh polleniferous materials were extracted using acetolysis methods. Detailed morphological evaluations were performed at x100 magnification. Results showed similarities and differences between species in the same genera, as well as differences between species in other families. Pollen study of these species revealed several similarities between species within the same family. Aperture type, forms, pollen grain size, sculpturing pattern, pollen dimension, and exine pattern were all studied for differences and similarities. Euphorbia hirta L and Euphorbia heterophylla L, both Euphorbiaceae species, have tricolpate apertures, are prolate in shape, reticulate, and contain small to medium pollen sizes. Asteraceae has tricolporate apertures, prolate spheroidal shapes, spinate, short and long spines, and pollen sizes ranging from microscopic to enormous (Ageratum conyzoides L, Tithonia diversifolia, and Tridax procumbens). Pollen from the family Fabaceae subfamily Caesalpinioideae (which includes Caesalpinia pulcherrima (L.) Swartz. and Senna alata (Linn.) Roxb) were found to be subprolate, coarsely reticulate, tricolporate, and with pollen sizes ranging from medium to large. Aperture measures such as number and diameter, pollen size, and spine height were suggestive in all of the species studied. Because all of the species studied exhibited comparable form and symmetry, they were grouped together and assigned to the same family.},

	abstract = {The clusioid clade is one of the major subclades identiﬁed within the large, diverse rosid order Malpighiales, using molecular data. However, nonmolecular synapomorphies are unclear, and more comparative data are needed to elucidate deep relationships within the order. In this article, pollen and tapetum characters are reevaluated in relation to recent hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within clusioids. This is done to shed light on the evolution of pollen and tapetum, particularly the evolution of pollen dyads, and also to assess the potential utility of pollen and tapetal characters in the systematics of the clusioids. The comparative morphology of pollen and tapetum is examined in selected taxa from Bonnetiaceae (Bonnetia), Calophylaceae (Caraipa), Clusiaceae (Clusia, Garcinia), Hypericaceae (Hypericum), and Podostemaceae (Podostemum). Pollen and tapetum characters in clusioids and selected outgroups are tabulated, based on both original observations and an extensive literature search, and then optimized onto a recent molecular phylogeny. The optimizations indicate that unusual pollen dispersed as dyads has evolved from monads in the late-branching Podostemoideae (Podostemaceae) clade. Relatively small-sized pollen (E ¼ 11–30 mm) is a potential synapomorphy for Hypericaceae and Podostemaceae, supporting the putative sister relationship between these two families, and pollen with circular or elliptic endoapertures is a potential synapomorphy for Bonnetiaceae. Several pollen characters (size, shape, apertures, and sculpture) indicate that Weddellina (Weddellinoideae: Podostemaceae) is more closely related to Hypericaceae than are Tristichoideae. Irregular granular exines have arisen several times independently within clusioids. A high level of polymorphism occurs in pollen characters in Clusiaceae and is probably related to high levels of diversity in ﬂoral morphology, pollination mechanisms, and pollinators, particularly in Clusia and Garcinia. By contrast, pollen of Podostemoideae is relatively uniform, despite developmental differences in microsporogenesis type and the presence of dyads. This may reﬂect evolutionary canalization or convergent evolution in these enigmatic aquatic plants.},

Acetolysed pollen grains were analyzed using light (LM) and scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM). The pollen grains varied in size (polar diameter) from medium to large, with the exception of Hexasepalum teres which was very large. Pollen grains were oblate spheroidal in most species, suboblate in six species, prolate spheroidal in Spermacoce rubescens and subprolate in Manettia fimbriata. All pollen grains were colporate, while number of apertures varied (three-19). The endoaperture was lolongate in most species and lalongate in four species. Sexine ornamentation varied among reticulate, reticulate-granulate, microreticulate, granulate with perforation, echinate-perforate and vermiculate. Pollen attributes were found to distinguish the studied species, but do not separate genera, confirming that Spermacoceae is euripolynic.},

Using high-resolution light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy imaging of the same pollen grains, we document pollen types of 35 genera including 15 studied for the ﬁrst time. Using a molecular phylogenetic framework based on currently available sequence data with good genus-coverage, we reconstruct trends in the evolution of Loranthaceae pollen and pinpoint traits of high diagnostic value, partly conﬁrming earlier intuitive hypotheses based on morphological observations. We ﬁnd that pollen morphology in Loranthaceae is strongly linked to phylogenetic relationships. Some pollen types are diagnostic for discrete genera or evolutionary lineages, opening the avenue to recruit dispersed fossil pollen as age constraints for dated phylogenies and as independent data for testing biogeographic scenarios; so far based exclusively on modern-day data. Correspondences and discrepancies between palynological and molecular data and current taxonomic/systematic concepts are identiﬁed and suggestions made for future palynological and molecular investigations of Loranthaceae.},

Within the triaperturate type, the pollen of the family ranges from unspecialized to moderately specialized. Differences in pollen morphology do not often serve to delineate the taxonomic tribes. The Berberidopsideae and Oncobeae show a considerable range of size and sculpturing patterns. Scolopieae, Banareae, Homalieae, and Flacourtieae have pollen which can scarcely be distinguished. Pollen of Casearieae is similar to that of the preceding group of tribes but adds more specialized trends. Both Pangieae and Paropsieae are isolated in the family, and the Paropsieae should be assigned to the Passifloraceae.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyse the pollen morphological diversity among 19 species of the Adesmieae and Aeschynomeneae tribes with the purpose of evaluating their importance for the taxonomical delimitation of the Argentinean species and their systematic significance. Observations and measurements were performed on acetolysed pollen grains. The samples were examined under light and scanning electron microscopes. Principal component analysis (PCA) and conglomerate analysis were performed for quantitative morphological variables. The tribe Adesmieae is stenopalynous while the tribe Aeschynomeneae is eurypalynous; their pollen grains are 3-colporate, and they have lolongate, circular or lalongate endoapertures, semitectate-reticulate or tectate-perforate, fossulate, suprarugulate exine, small to large size, and suboblate to prolate shapes. A key was made to identify and distinguish species of Adesmia, Aeschynomene, Chaetocalyx, Discolobium, and Poiretia. Exine sculpture and structure, presene of operculum, exine thickness, pollen shape, endoaperture shape, and pollen size all had taxonomic importance to distinguish the species inhabiting Argentina. The groupings recognised in recent classifications are hard to delimit on the basis of the palynological knowledge at this time since there are different pollen types but various of them occur among the three subclades. A framework for future evolutionary analyses within the dalbergioid clade is thus provided.},

	abstract = {Abstract. New detailed vegetation reconstructions are proposed in Atlantic Central Africa from a modern pollen data set derived from 199 sites (Cameroon, Gabon and Congo) including 131 new sites. In this study, the concept of plant functional classification is improved with new and more detailed plant functional types (PFTs) and new aggregations of pollen taxa. Using the biomisation method, we reconstructed (1) modern potential biomes and (2) potential succession stages of forest regeneration, a new approach in Atlantic Central African vegetation dynamics and ecosystem functioning reconstruction. When compared to local vegetation, potential biomes are correctly reconstructed (97.5\% of the sites) and tropical evergreen to semi-evergreen forest (TRFO biome) is well identified from semi-deciduous forest (TSFO biome). When the potential biomes are superimposed on the White's vegetation map, only 76.4\% of the sites are correctly reconstructed. But using botanical data, correspondence and cluster analyses, the 43 sites from Congo (Mayombe) evidence more affinities with those of central Gabon and so they can also be considered as correctly reconstructed as TRFO biome and White's map must be revised. In terms of potential succession stages of forest regeneration, the mature forest (TMFO) is well differentiated from the secondary forest (TSFE), but inside this latter group, the young and the pioneer stages are not clearly identified due probably to their low sampling representation. Moreover, linked to their progressive and mosaic character, the boundaries between two forest biomes or two forest stages are not clearly detected and need also a more intensive sampling in such transitions.},

	abstract = {Pollen of 69 species representing 34 genera from 12 of the 13 tribes of Crotonoideaesensu Webster was examined in light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pollen of the vast majority of the subfamily is inaperturate, and all Crotonoideaeexines have a similar architecture: triangular supratectal elements attached to a network of muri having short or irregular columellae. These three components, triangular supratectal elements, muri, and modified columellae constitute the Croton structure. The triangular elements, designated subunits, can be psilate, striate, furrowed and ridged, or pitted, and with echinate, rounded, or long-attenuate apices; the subunits can be closely spaced or arrayed in more open configurations. A Croton sculpture refers to the presence of triangular sculpture elements, which may or may not have muri and modified columellae. Inaperturate grains have thin footlayers and thin endexines, whereas colpate pollen has both footlayer and endexine well developed; in porate grains, the footlayer and endexine appear intermediate between inaperturate and colpate. Tribes Micrandreae (Hevea, Micrandra, Micrandropsis examined) and Adenoclineae (Adenocline, Ditta, Glycydendron, Endospermum, Klaineanthus, Tetrorchidium)are 3-colpate and probablyprimitive, having retained not only apertures but (prominent) footlayers and endexines as well; Manihoteae (Manihot, Cnidoscolus examined) and Gelonieae (Suregada) are porate. The thicker aperturate exines, especially in the colpate grains, may be linked with retention of apertures.

              Anomanthodiu
              to 59 μm in
              Posoqueria

Previous research showed the separation of Phelipanche from Orobanche, a ﬁnding which is also supported by pollen aperture type and exine ornamentation. The pollen of Phelipanche is tricolpate, while that of Orobanche is inaperturate. Our research showed that one of the species included so far within Orobanche, namely O. coerulescens, has tricolpate pollen with microreticulate sculpture. As a consequence of the ﬁnding of tricolpate pollen and intermediate macromorphological characteristics of this species between Orobanche and Phelipanche, it is proposed to transfer it to a new genus, Orobanchella, described in the paper. A comparison of the main characteristics distinguishing Orobanche, Phelipanche, Boulardia and Orobanchella is also presented and discussed.},

The pollen grains of the studied species are characterized by similarities in size, shape, aperture type and differences in exine sculpture (reticulate semitectate exine in Neurada and ﬁnely reticulate to foveolate in Grielum) and sporoderm ultrastructure. The cavea in the exine is situated between the ectexine and endexine which are connected near the aperture region only. A combination of the palynological characters of the Neuradaceae (semitectate exine, rather loose columellae, interrupted foot layer, the cavea in the exine) increases the pollen plasticity, allowing considerable changes of the pollen grain volume but still remains insufﬁcient to survive sharp ﬂuctuations in hydration level.},

Its rapid colonization and adaptation to Andean forests have affected the composition and structure of indigenous plant communities. In this research, analysis of functional traits was carried out, generating new information that could explain the rapid colonization, adaptation and invasive potential of T. alata in this type of Andean environment.
Methods: To obtain this information, a series of observations were made on the morphology and anatomy of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds. Likewise, a characterization of its floral visitors and symbiotic relationships with soil microorganisms was carried out. Key results: We determined that both morphological traits and interaction phenomena favour the adaptability of T. alata in Andean forests and could contribute to a greater extent to its active colonization in this type of environment. An active association of T. alata was found with different species of native and introduced floral visitors, with a total of 2266 floral visits made during our study by seven species of insects belonging to the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Mycorrhizal fungal spores associated with T. alata populations were found at all sampling sites. The number of spores per 100 g of soil varied between 300 and 424. All the roots of T. alata, without exception, had high colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
Conclusions: We believe that the information obtained in this research will contribute to the generation of comprehensive and effective strategies for the control of this species in Andean forests.},

              We demonstrate that combining optical superresolution imaging with deep learning classification methods increases the speed and accuracy of assessing the biological affinities of fossil pollen taxa. We show that it is possible to taxonomically separate pollen grains that appear morphologically similar under standard light microscopy based on nanoscale variation in pollen shape, texture, and wall structure. Using a single pollen morphospecies,
              Striatopollis catatumbus
              , we show that nanoscale morphological variation within the fossil taxon coincides with paleobiogeographic distributions. This new approach improves the taxonomic resolution of fossil pollen identifications and greatly enhances the use of pollen data in ecological and evolutionary research.
            
          , 
            
              Taxonomic resolution is a major challenge in palynology, largely limiting the ecological and evolutionary interpretations possible with deep-time fossil pollen data. We present an approach for fossil pollen analysis that uses optical superresolution microscopy and machine learning to create a quantitative and higher throughput workflow for producing palynological identifications and hypotheses of biological affinity. We developed three convolutional neural network (CNN) classification models: maximum projection (MPM), multislice (MSM), and fused (FM). We trained the models on the pollen of 16 genera of the legume tribe Amherstieae, and then used these models to constrain the biological classifications of 48 fossil
              Striatopollis
              specimens from the Paleocene, Eocene, and Miocene of western Africa and northern South America. All models achieved average accuracies of 83 to 90\% in the classification of the extant genera, and the majority of fossil identifications (86\%) showed consensus among at least two of the three models. Our fossil identifications support the paleobiogeographic hypothesis that Amherstieae originated in Paleocene Africa and dispersed to South America during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 Ma). They also raise the possibility that at least three Amherstieae genera (
              Crudia
              ,
              Berlinia
              , and
              Anthonotha
              ) may have diverged earlier in the Cenozoic than predicted by molecular phylogenies.},

	abstract = {The pollen morphology of 73 species of Acalypha representing most of the taxonomic diversity in the genus was examined with light and scanning electron microscopy, and 14 species with transmission electron microscopy. Acalypha pollen is small (9–22 μm), subisopolar to isopolar or apolar, and oblate-spheroidal to suboblate in meridional outline. The aperture system is 2-8colporate, with the ectocolpi short (1–5 μm) and almost equal in length to the endopore diameter. Exine ornamentation is rugulate to microrugulate or areolate with distinct scabrae localized on the margins of the muri or scattered over the pollen surface. These results show that Acalypha pollen exhibits significant variation in size, aperture number, aperture distribution and exine ornamentation, and is not homogeneous as previously reported. Two distinct types, each with two subtypes, were recognized based on tectal ornamentation. Though pollen morphology is inconsistent with a phylogeny based on ITS and ndhF sequence data, it does provide support for subgenera Linostachys and Androcephala and several small clades in the molecular phylogeny.},

	abstract = {Pollen character evolution in yams (Dioscorea: Dioscoreaceae) was investigated in relation to the phylogeny obtained from a recent combined analysis of rbcL and matK gene sequences. The following characters were evaluated: pollen size, aperture number, sexine ornamentation, perforation density, and orbicule presence or absence. Continuous characters were coded using the gap weighting method. Each character was optimized using MacClade onto a tree selected at random from analyses based on molecular data of Wilkin et al. The results indicate that in Dioscorea pollen size decreases in the more derived clades. The latter observation may be related to the evolution of annually replaced tubers. Aperture number increases from one in the monosulcate Stenophora clade (sister to the rest of Dioscorea) to two in other Dioscorea clades. This may be related to the presence of simultaneous microsporogenesis in Dioscorea. A perforate sexine is plesiomorphic in Dioscorea and a striate pattern has evolved more than once and is particularly characteristic in the Malagasy clade. Sexine ornamentation in the Stenophora clade is diverse. The endemic allotetraploid D. pyrenaica is characterized by large, mono sulcate, gemmate pollen. The Dioscorea B clade is characterized by pollen with small, dense perforations. Orbicules occur in all Dioscorea species, but are absent in most of the outgroup taxa.},

Identiﬁcations are best achieved through the direct inspection of reference material. Most substantial reference collections are located at research institutions in Europe or North America, which restricts access for researchers trying to advance palynology in less developed countries. Due to the development of digital imaging and fast internet access it is now possible to produce high quality images from pollen and spore reference collections and make them globally available. In this pollen and spore atlas we contribute to this growing body of work by presenting images of 240 pollen types (in 202 genera and {\textasciitilde}79 families) and 30 spore types (in 25 genera and {\textasciitilde}17 families) from a wide range of different vegetation types originating from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. We provide an overview on the range of pollen and spore types commonly found in Last Glacial and Holocene sedimentary archives in studies from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. Besides a pollen key, detailed information is given on pollination, habitus and habitat which all support the interpretation and environmental reconstructions from pollen records. The atlas will serve as useful guide for palynological investigations, aiming at detailed and comprehensive reconstruction of past vegetation, environmental and climate change in tropical East Africa.},

	abstract = {The monophyletic tribe Cercideae is one of the earliest branching lineages in Leguminosae, sister to the rest of the family. It is a highly varied and complex group which has undergone many taxonomic re-organisations, and is currently the subject of further systematic studies. The pollen of the Cercideae has long been known to be diverse and varied, but problematic species and generic delimitations have previously hindered our understanding of the similarities, differences, evolution and taxonomic significance of the various pollen structures found within the tribe. This study aims to better understand the complexities of the pollen morphological variation by assessing them with regard to recent phylogenetic studies, and also to provide pollen characters that will help to gain more resolution in systematic studies. Approximately 250 pollen samples from tribe Cercideae were studied using light as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, with 58 of those samples taken from 55 species of 12 genera matching those analysed in a recent molecular phylogeny. The distribution of morphological structures is examined by mapping them onto a recently published molecular phylogenetic tree. Using the molecular phylogeny to show pollen diversity and distribution, we provide an overview of pollen morphology in the Cercideae. The first branching lineages in tribe Cercideae have an unspecialised pollen type, whereas the more variable and distinct pollen types are found in the more derived lineages, in Schnella, Lasiobema, Phanera and Bauhinia s.str. There is a high degree of specialisation in surface ornamentation, wall structure and aperture type in these groups when compared to other caesalpinioid taxa. The Cercideae is currently the subject of much research. This overview of pollen structure presents a summary of the distribution of pollen morphological variation, providing data which allows the structural variation in pollen to be compared and contrasted in evolutionary and taxonomic contexts. It also provides potential autapomorphic and synapomorphic palynological characters of use in phylogenetic analyses and taxonomy.},

            Detarioideae
            is one of the most florally diverse legume lineages, in which the 84 genera and ca. 760 species variously interact with pollinating bees, bats, and birds. However, pollen ornamentation has not been extensively studied in the subfamily. Here we focus on describing the morphological variation of pollen ornamentation in the
            Hymenaea
            clade, a small lineage comprised of ca. 65 species in the florally heterogeneous genera
            Guibourtia

            Hymenaea

            clade but also its highly variable pollen ornamentation.},

An attempt was made to correlate the pollen morphology with the taxonomy of th: family. The pollen morphological data provide clear support in favour of the division of the family into two separate families, respectively, Ihloragaceae and Gunneraceae. noth subfamilies, it., Haloragoideae Schindl. (excluding a few species in the subsection Spongiocarpus Schindl.) and Gunnxoideae Schindl., are stenopalynous. Important arguments concerning pollen morphology, gross morphology, ecology, and type of pollination, favour a regroupment of the Hnlorngis spxies belonging to the subsection Spongiocarpus, which is related to the genus Latidoniu Lindl. Eventual fusion of these IIalorugis species in th: subsection Spongiocarpus with the genus Lorrdoiria is worth consideration. The Haloragaceae is an interesting plant group from a palaeobotanical point of view. A review of the literature concerning fossil findings of the Haloragaceac and sporomorphs of the Stemmn Normapolles Pf.,- some of which most probably could have bten related with the Haloragaceae, point out th: interest of this family to palaeobotany.},

	abstract = {The pollen morphology of 398 species from all but five of the 53 genera of the Sapotaceae defined by Pennington (1991) in his recent generic review, has been studied using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Within the family pollen diversity is sufficient for twelve pollen types to be described, eleven of which have been further subdivided. A key to the pollen types and further keys to the numerous subtypes that occur within Pollen Types I-VIII are provided. In two Chrysophyllum species, C. marginatum subsp. marginatum and C. inornatum, the structure of the pollen wall is anomalous within the Sapotaceae. The infratectum is comprised of long, slender columellae whereas in all other species examined it is narrow, granular or comprised of reduced columellae. In the other anomalous species, Englerophytum stelechantha, the apertures are more or less porate and represent an extreme of the colporate condition observed in other species in the family. The pollen types are considered in relation to Pennington's revision of the family and the contribution that pollen morphology has made towards resolving taxonomic uncertainties. A broad tribal correlation is observed between Mimusopeae with Pollen Types I \& III; Isonandreae with Pollen Type II; Sideroxyleae with Pollen Type VI; Chrysophylleae with Pollen Type VII and Omphalocarpeae with Pollen Type VIII. There are examples of genera in which only one pollen type or subtype occurs, although not exclusively: Burckella, Pollen Type I; Sarcosperma, Pollen Type IV and Omphalocarpum, Pollen Type VIII. A few pollen subtypes are restricted to only one genus: Delpydora subtype VIIC; Sarcaulus, subtype XIA; Chromolucuma, subtype XIC and Diploon, subtype XIIA. Pollen Type IX occurs only in Pouteria, sect. Oxythece. Aperture configuration and the appearance of the tectum from scanning electron microscopy have been found to be particularly useful in defining differences between pollen types. The wall stratification, comprising a very thick tectum and foot layer intersected by a narrow infratectum, is unusual. Both the functional rationale of this type of pollen wall and the occurrence of a granular infratectum in both primitive and more highly evolved angiosperm families are considered. A variable number of (usually 3-4 or 4-5) regularly spaced apertures between pollen grains within single samples is apparently normal within the Sapotaceae; possible reasons for this are discussed.},

Pollen data of 125 out of the 128 genera including all 19 Fevilleoideae genera were available. In view of a broad overlap, pollen grain size is not a reliable criterium to separate both subfamilies. Striate and microstriate ornamentation appeared to be very useful in identifying cucurbitaceous plants as Fevilleoideae. The perforate-rugulate type of Alsomitra is unique in the family. Gerrardanthus cannot be indicated as a member of the Fevilleoideae with pollen features alone, its relatively large (micro)reticulate pollen being similar to that of several Cucurbitoideae. On the basis of outgroup comparison, either striate or perforate-rugulate might be considered as the plesiomorphic ornamentation state in the family Cucurbitaceae. The (micro)reticulate type occurring commonly in the Cucurbitoideae evolved later, probably from a striate ancestral type and parallel to the (micro)reticulate type of the fevilleoid genus Gerrardanthus. The more or less striate (reticulate-striate) ornamentation found in seven genera in three Cucurbitoideae tribes probably evolved at least five times from (micro)reticulate ancestors.},

Papilionoideae is a eurypalynous subfamily. The pollen grains are generally free, radially symmetrical, isopolar, mostly tricolporate, rarely colpate or porate. The shape is commonly prolate to sub-prolate, or prolate-spherodial, less commonly to oblate-spheroidal or sub-oblate, often perprolate. The ora is commonly la-longate or circular, rarely lolongate. Colpal membrane is psilate to sub-psilate or granulated, often scabrate. The sexine is thicker than or as thick as the nexine. A reticulate tectum type is the most common. However, other tectum types i.e., rugulate, foveolate, striate and areolate tectum, are also found in a considerable number of taxa. The delimitation of genera on the basis of pollen characteristics is difficult. However, shape, apertural types and eine ornamentation were found to be more significant pollen characters.

In contrast Rhizophoraceae sensu stricto forms a phenetic continuum, with pollen of Macarisieae intermediate between Gynotrocheae and Rhizophoreae. Endoapertures of Anisophylleaceae pollen, when present, are circular and poorly defined, whereas all species of Rhizophoraceae possess endoapertures with some degree offusion.

Formal generic pollen descriptions are provided for each of t-hese genera. Our study shows that each possesses a distinctive pollen type which is most readily separated from pollen of the other mainland African Myristicaceae on the basis of differences in exine sculpturing and structure. Distinctive palynological features include the reticulate sculpturing with beaded muri of Coelocaryon, the numerous, blunt spines of Pycnanthus, and the minutely "crotonoid" sculpturing pattern of Scyphocephalium. Pollen of Cephalosphaera shows marked resemblances to that of the Madagascan myristicaceous genus Mauloutchia.},

	abstract = {Nitraria
              is a halophytic taxon (i.e., adapted to saline environments) that belongs to the plant family Nitrariaceae and is distributed from the Mediterranean, across Asia into the south-eastern tip of Australia. This taxon is thought to have originated in Asia during the Paleogene (66–23 Ma), alongside the proto-Paratethys epicontinental sea. The evolutionary history of
              Nitraria
              might hold important clues on the links between climatic and biotic evolution but limited taxonomic documentation of this taxon has thus far hindered this line of research. Here we investigate if the pollen morphology and the chemical composition of the pollen wall are informative of the evolutionary history of
              Nitraria
              and could explain if origination along the proto-Paratethys and dispersal to the Tibetan Plateau was simultaneous or a secondary process. To answer these questions, we applied a novel approach consisting of a combination of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), to determine the chemical composition of the pollen wall, and pollen morphological analyses using Light Microscopy (LM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). We analysed our data using ordinations (principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling), and directly mapped it on the Nitrariaceae phylogeny to produce a phylomorphospace and a phylochemospace. Our LM, SEM and FTIR analyses show clear morphological and chemical differences between the sister groups
              Peganum
              and
              Nitraria
              . Differences in the morphological and chemical characteristics of highland species (
              Nitraria schoberi, N. sphaerocarpa, N. sibirica
              and
              N. tangutorum)
              and lowland species (
              Nitraria billardierei
              and
              N. retusa)
              are very subtle, with phylogenetic history appearing to be a more important control on
              Nitraria
              pollen than local environmental conditions. Our approach shows a compelling consistency between the chemical and morphological characteristics of the eight studied Nitrariaceae species, and these traits are in agreement with the phylogenetic tree. Taken together, this demonstrates how novel methods for studying fossil pollen can facilitate the evolutionary investigation of living and extinct taxa, and the environments they represent.},
