Plant height,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,continuous (m),"Plant height is the distance in metres between the upper limit of photosynthetic tissue and the ground level (McElwain et al. 2024). Tall plants are favourable for seed dispersal and light absorption but have construction and maintenance costs (Fyllas et al. 2020, Brussel and Brewer 2021). This trait is related to plant survival, as it determines the competitive ability of the plant (E-Vojtkó et al. 2020).","Blonder, B., Enquist, B. J., Graae, B. J., Kattge, J., Maitner, B.

Seed mass,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,continuous (mg),"Seed mass is related to dispersal, colonisation and establishment ability (Fyllas et al. 2020, E-Vojtkó et al. 2020). Lighter seeds are produced in greater numbers and can disperse further. However, larger and heavier seeds are more beneficial for surviving the early stages of recruitment (Brussel and Brewer 2021).","Blonder, B., Enquist, B. J., Graae, B. J., Kattge, J., Maitner, B.

Leaf area,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,continuous (mm2),"Leaf area is related to photosynthetic processes, water balances and resource investment (Díaz et al. 2016, E-Vojtkó et al. 2020, Fyllas et al. 2020). Larger leaves capture more light, so they increase the photosynthetic capacity and reduce transpiration rates but have higher construction costs (Brussel and Brewer 2021). ","Blonder, B., Enquist, B.

Leaf type (leaf form),Categorical,TRY DATABASE,broad-leaved/needle-leaved/scale leaved,"Leaf type refers to the overall shape and structure of leaves. Broad-leaved species typically adopt more active water-use strategies, while needle-leaved species often exhibit more conservative strategies, such as lower stomatal conductance and higher hydraulic safety margins. These adaptations result in reduced photosynthesis rates but greater resilience to extreme conditions, allowing needle-leaved species to thrive in harsher environments (Ma et al. 2023).","Lézine, A.

Vegetative phenology,Categorical,BIEN DATABASE,evergreen/deciduous,"Vegetative phenology refers to the type of leaf phenology, i.e. long-lived evergreen and short-lived deciduous leaves. While evergreen leaves have a longer leaf life, year-round photosynthetic activity and lower nutrient requirements, deciduous leaves minimise transpiration and respiration during dry periods and have lower maintenance costs and higher carbon gain during favourable conditions (Givnish 2002; van Ommen Kloeke et al. 2012).","Lézine, A.

Leaf dry mass per area (LMA),Leaf dry mass/LEAF AREA,BIEN DATABASE,continuous (g/mm2),"Leaf dry mass per area (LMA) is calculated by dividing the dry mass of the leaf by its area (Díaz et al. 2022; McElwain et al. 2024). This trait is related to resource allocation strategies and to leaf economy. Leaves with low LMA have a faster growth rate and stomatal conductance, while leaves with high LMA have longer leaf lifespan and lower leaf nitrogen concentration. LMA is an important predictor of ecosystem productivity and the nutrient cycle (McElwain et al. 2024). ","McElwain, J. C., Matthaeus, W.

Leaf life span,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,discrete (months),"Leaf lifespan is the length of time the leaf is physiologically active. This trait is related to nutrient use strategies, leaf decomposition and palatability. Leaf lifespan is important for the hydrological cycle and the ecosystem productivity. Short-lived leaves allocate nutrients towards high rates of photosynthesis, while longer-lived leaves tend to invest nutrients in leaf protection (McElwain et al. 2024).","McElwain, J.

Longest whole plant longevity,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,discrete (years),"Longest plant longevity is the highest maximum lifespan of a plant. This trait reflects the environmental adaptation of plant communities, and how they respond to biotic and abiotic stresses (McElwain et al. 2024). Short-lived plants (annuals/biennials) have rapid growth and reproduction rates, while long-lived plants (such as gymnosperms and arboreal angiosperms) have a slow growth rate and typically live in harsh conditions with low resources (McElwain et al. 2024).","McElwain, J.

Whole plant sexual system,Categorical,BIEN DATABASE,hermaphrodite/dioecious,"The plant sexual system is the type of sex allocation pattern that exists in a species. Although there is a wide range of reproductive sexual systems in plants, hermaphrodites (both sexes in an individual) and deciduous plants (separate sexes) are the most common and stable sexual systems (Leonard 2018). Flowering plants are predominantly hermaphroditic and have high reproductive success rates, although they increase the risk of inbreeding depression and thus reduce the fitness of offspring. In contrast, dioecious species have lower reproductive success rates, especially when there is a lack of available pollinators, but avoid inbreeding depression and can live in harsh environments (Peng et al. 2014).

Flower pollination syndrome,Categorical,BIEN DATABASE,biotic/abiotic,Floral pollination syndrome is the set of floral traits that are linked to a specific functional group of pollinators (Rosas-Guerrero et al. 2014; Ollerton et al. 2015). It has been argued that traits have evolved convergently in different angiosperm lineages in response to pollinator type (Ollerton et al. 2015).,"Rosas-Guerrero, V., Aguilar, R., Martén-Rodríguez, S., Ashworth, L., Lopezaraiza-Mikel, M., Bastida, J.

Plant flowering begin,Continuous,BIEN DATABASE,discrete (month of the year),"Flowering phenology is the time at which plants flower and is very important in plant ecology, as it affects plant success and interactions between species. The overlap of plant flowering between different species in a community increases competition, but also enhances pollination resources. In addition, when plants flower under adverse environmental conditions, their fecundity and thus their survival decreases (Craine et al. 2012). ","Craine, J. M., Wolkovich, E.
